As nouns the difference between realm and world is that realm is an abstract sphere of influence,
real or imagined while world is human collective existence; existence in general. 

As a verb world is  to consider or cause to be considered from a global perspective;
to consider as a global whole, rather than making or focussing on national or other distinctions;
compare globalise.
