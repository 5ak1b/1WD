The modern day codex of Uthman(the-quran) seems to be the collection of 114 booklets.  The booklets are referred to as Chapters/Surahs.
Chapter-1 was not recited during the lifetime of Muhammad. (non-verified info)
Chapter-113/114 are assumed to be supplications taught to Muhammad by Gabriel(one of the angelic/demonic/superheroic/being of other dimensions, based on 
what terminology one uses for communicating the intended meaning) for his illness; after which he was fine(presumably).
(not to be confused with miracles.)
