The Koran/Codex of Arabia/Mushaf_al-uthmani etc. contains verses that are assumed to be scrambled in unknown manner (known to the scramblers).
The chapters/booklets don't seem to be in its entirety.
There seems to be addition of new words, verses or even addition/deletion of chapters.
The meaning of not only the verses but even words has changed over the period of 1400 or so years. 

GOD/Creator/Prabhu/Allah etc. knows best for he is the true Protector of us all.
