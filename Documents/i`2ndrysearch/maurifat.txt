Islam emphasizes that God is strictly singular (taw?id?): unique (wa?id?), inherently unique (a?ad?),[3] also all-merciful and omnipotent.[4]
According to Islamic teachings, beyond the Throne [5] and according to the Quran, "No vision can grasp him, but His grasp is over all vision:
He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things."[6].
