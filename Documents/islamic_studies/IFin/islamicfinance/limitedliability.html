        <b>Introduction</b><a name="intro"></a><br>
        The concept of 'limited liability' has now become an inseparable ingredient 
        of the large scale enterprises of trade and industry throughout the modern 
        world, including the Muslim countries. The present chapter aims to explain 
        this concept and evaluate it from the Shari&#145;ah point of view in order 
        to know whether or not this principle is acceptable in a pure Islamic 
        economy. The limited liability' in the modern economic and legal terminology 
        is a condition under which a partner or a shareholder of a business secures 
        himself from bearing a loss greater than the amount he has invested in 
        a company or partner-ship with limited liability. If the business incurs 
        a loss, the maximum a shareholder can suffer, is that he may lose his 
        entire original investment. But the loss cannot extend to his personal 
        assets, and if the assets of the company are not sufficient to discharge 
        all its liabilities, the creditors cannot claim the remaining part of 
        their receivables from the personal assets of the shareholders. <br>
        <br>
        Although the concept of 'limited liability' was, in some countries applied 
        to the partnership also, yet, it was most commonly applied to the companies 
        and corporate bodies. Rather, it will be more true, perhaps, to say that 
        the concept of 'limited liability' originally emerged with the emergence 
        of the corporate bodies and joint stock companies. The basic purpose of 
        the introduction of this principle was to attract the maximum number of 
        investors to the large-scale joint ventures and to assure them that their 
        personal fortunes will not be at stake if they wish to invest their savings 
        in such a joint enterprise. In the practice of modern trade, the concept 
        proved itself to be a vital force to mobilize large amounts of capital 
        from a wide range of investors. <br>
        <br>
        No doubt, the concept of 'limited liability' is beneficial to the shareholders 
        of a company. But, at the same time, it may be injurious to its creditors. 
        If the liabilities of a limited company exceed its assets, the company 
        becomes insolvent and is consequently liquidated, the creditors may lose 
        a considerable amount of their claims, because they can only receive the 
        liquidated value of the assets of the company, and have no recourse to 
        its shareholders for the rest of their claims. Even the directors of the 
        company who may be responsible for such an unfortunate situation cannot 
        be held responsible for satisfying the claims of the creditors. It is 
        this aspect of the concept of 'limited liability' which requires consideration 
        and research from the Shari&#145;ah viewpoint. <br>
        <br>
        Although the concept of 'limited liability' in the context of the modern 
        commercial practice is a new concept and finds no express mention as such 
        in the original sources of Islamic Fiqh, yet the Shari&#145;ah viewpoint 
        about it can be sought in the principles laid down by the Holy Qur&#146;an, 
        the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet ? and the Islamic jurisprudence. This exercise 
        requires some sort of ijtihad carried out by the persons qualified for 
        it. This ijtihad should preferably be undertaken by the Shari&#145;ah 
        scholars at a collective level, yet, as a pre-requisite, there should 
        be some individual efforts which may serve as a basis for the collective 
        exercise. <br>
        <br>
        As a humble student of Shari&#145;ah, this author have been considering 
        the issue since long, and what is going to be presented in this article 
        should not be treated as a final verdict on this subject, nor an absolute 
        opinion on the point. It is the outcome of initial thinking on the subject, 
        and the purpose of this article is to provide a foundation for further 
        research. <br>
        The question of 'limited liability' it can be said, is closely related 
        to the concept of juridical personality of the modern corporate bodies. 
        According to this concept, a joint-stock company in itself enjoys the 
        status of a separate entity as distinguished from the individual entities 
        of its shareholders. The separate entity as a fictive person has legal 
        personality and may thus sue and be sued, may make contracts, may hold 
        property in its name, and has the legal status of a natural person in 
        all its transactions entered into in the capacity of a juridical person. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The basic question, it is believed, is whether the concept of a 'juridical 
        person' is acceptable in Shari&#145;ah or not. Once the concept of 'juridical 
        person' is accepted and it is admitted that, despite its fictive nature, 
        a juridical person can be treated as a natural person in respect of the 
        legal consequences of the transactions made in its name, we will have 
        to accept the concept of 'limited liability' which will follow as a logical 
        result of the former concept. The reason is obvious. If a real person 
        i.e. a human being dies insolvent, his creditors have no claim except 
        to the extent of the assets he has left behind. If his liabilities exceed 
        his assets, the creditors will certainly suffer, no remedy being left 
        for them after the death of the indebted person. <br>
        <br>
        Now, if we accept that a company, in its capacity of a juridical person, 
        has the rights and obligations similar to those of a natural person, the 
        same principle will apply to an insolvent company. A company, after becoming 
        insolvent, is bound to be liquidated: and the liquidation of a company 
        corresponds to the death of a person, because a company after its liquidation, 
        cannot exist any more. If the creditors of a real person can suffer, when 
        he dies insolvent, the creditors of a juridical person may suffer too, 
        when its legal life comes to an end by its liquidation. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the basic question is whether or not the concept of 'juridical 
        person' is acceptable to Shari&#145;ah. Although the idea of a juridical 
        person, as envisaged by the modern economic and legal systems has not 
        been dealt with in the Islamic Fiqh, yet there are certain prcedents wherefrom 
        the basic concept of a juridical person may be derived by inference. <br>
        <br>
        <b> Waqf </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> ) <a name="waqf"></a><br>
        The first precedent is that of a Waqf. The Waqf is a legal and religious 
        institution wherein a person dedicates some of his properties for a religious 
        or a charitable purpose. The properties, after being declared as Waqf, 
        no longer remain in the ownership of the donor. The beneficiaries of a 
        Waqf can benefit from the corpus or the proceeds of the dedicated property, 
        but they are not its owners. Its ownership vests in Allah Almighty alone. 
        <br>
        It seems that the Muslim jurists have treated the Waqf as a separate legal 
        entity and have ascribed to it some characteristics similar to those of 
        a natural person. This will be clear from two rulings given by the fuqaha&#146; 
        (Muslim jurists) in respect of Waqf. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Firstly</b>, if a property is purchased with the income of a Waqf, 
        the purchased property cannot become a part of the Waqf automatically. 
        Rather, the jurists say, the property so purchased shall be treated as 
        a property owned by the Waqf. It clearly means that a Waqf, like a natural 
        person, can own a property . <br>
        <b><br>
        Secondly</b>, the jurists have clearly mentioned that the money given 
        to a mosque as donation does not form part of the Waqf, but it passes 
        to the ownership of the mosque. <br>
        Here again the mosque is accepted to be an owner of money. This principle 
        has been expressly mentioned by some jurists of the Maliki school also. 
        They have stated that a mosque is capable of being the owner of something. 
        This capability of the mosque, according to them, is constructive, while 
        the capability enjoyed by a human being is physical. <br>
        <br>
        Another renowned Maliki jurist, namely, Ahmad Al-Dardir, validates a bequest 
        made in favour of a mosque, and gives the reason that a mosque can own 
        properties. Not only this, he extends the principle to an inn and a bridge 
        also, provided that they are Waqf. <br>
        It is clear from these examples that the Muslim jurists have accepted 
        that a Waqf can own properties. Obviously, a Waqf is not a human being, 
        yet they have treated it as a human being in the matter of ownership. 
        Once its ownership it established, it will logically follow that it can 
        sell and purchase, may become a debtor and a creditor and can sue and 
        be sued, and thus all the characteristics of a 'juridical person' can 
        be attributed to it. <br>
        <br>
        <b> Baitul-Mal</b> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> ) <a name="baitul"></a><br>
        Another example of 'juridical person' found in our classic literature 
        of Fiqh is that of the Baitul-mal (the exchequer of an Islamic state). 
        Being public property, all the citizens of an Islamic state have some 
        beneficial right over the Baitul-mal, yet, nobody can claim to be its 
        owner. Still, the Baitul-mal has some rights and obligations. Imam Al-Sarakhsi, 
        the well-known Hanafi jurist, says in his work &quot;Al-Mabsut&quot;: 
        <br>
        <b>&quot;The Baitul-mal has some rights and obligations which may possibly 
        be undetermined.&quot; </b><br>
        <br>
        At another place the same author says: <b>&quot;If the head of an Islamic 
        state needs money to give salaries to his army, but he finds no money 
        in the Kharaj department of the Baitul-mal (wherefrom the salaries are 
        generally given) he can give salaries from the sadaqah (Zakah) department, 
        but the amount so taken from the sadaqah department shall be deemed to 
        be a debt on the Kharaj department&quot;. </b><br>
        <br>
        It follows from this that not only the Baitul-mal, but also the different 
        departments therein can borrow and advance loans to each other. The liability 
        of these loans does not lie on the head of state, but on the concerned 
        department of Baitul-mal. It means that each department of Baitul-mal 
        is a separate entity and in that capacity it can advance and borrow money, 
        may be treated a debtor or a creditor, and thus can sue and be sued in 
        the same manner as a juridical person does. It means that the Fuqaha of 
        Islam have accepted the concept of juridical person in respect of Baitul-mal. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Joint Stock </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> ) <a name="joing"></a><br>
        Another example very much close to the concept of 'juridical person' in 
        a joint stock company is found in the Fiqh of Imam Shafi&#145;i. According 
        to a settled principle of Shafi&#145;i School, if more than one person 
        run their business in partner-ship, where their assets are mixed with 
        each other, the Zakah will be levied on each of them individually, but 
        it will be payable on their joint-stock as a whole, so much so that even 
        if one of them does not own the amount of the nisab, but the combined 
        value of the total assets exceeds the prescribed limit of the nisab, zakah 
        will be payable on the whole joint-stock including the share of the former, 
        and thus the person whose share is less than the nisab shall also contribute 
        to the levy in proportion to his ownership in the total assets, whereas 
        he was not subject to the levy of zakah, had it been levied on each person 
        in his individual capacity. <br>
        The same principle, which is called the principle of 'Khultah-al-Shuyu&#145;' 
        is more forcefully applied to the levy of Zakah on the livestock. Consequently, 
        a person sometimes has to pay more Zakah than he was liable to in his 
        individual capacity, and sometimes he has to pay less than that. <br>
        That is why the Holy Prophet <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">has 
        said: <br>

            <br>
            <b>'The separate assets should not be joined together nor the joint 
            assets should be separated in order to reduce the amount of Zakah 
            levied on them. <br>
            </b> </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="justify">This principle of 'Khultah-al-Shuyu&#145;' which is also 
        accepted to some extent by the Maliki and Hanbali schools with some variance 
        in details, has a basic concept of a juridical person underlying it. It 
        is not the individual, according to this principle, who is liable to Zakah. 
        It is the 'joint-stock' which has been made subject to the levy. It means 
        that the 'joint-stock' has been treated a separate entity, and the obligation 
        of 'zakah has been diverted towards this entity which is very close to 
        the concept of a 'juridical person', though it is not exactly the same.<br>

  <tr>
    <td align="left" valign="top"> 
      <p align="justify"><b>Inheritance under debt</b> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        ) <a name="inheritance"></a><br>
        The fourth example is the property left by a deceased person whose liabilities 
        exceed the value of all the property left by him. For the purpose of brevity 
        we can refer to it as 'inheritance under debt'. <br>
        <br>
        According to the jurists, this property is neither owned by the deceased, 
        because he is no more alive, nor is it owned by his heirs, for the debts 
        on the deceased have a preferential right over the property as compared 
        to the rights of the heirs. It is not even owned by the creditors, because 
        the settlement has not yet taken place. They have their claims over it, 
        but it is not their property unless it is actually divided between them. 
        Being property of nobody, it has its own existence and it can be termed 
        a legal entity. The heirs of the deceased or his nominated executor will 
        look after the property as managers, but they are not the owners. If the 
        process of the settlement of debt requires some expenses, the same will 
        be met by the property itself. <br>
        <br>
        Looked at from this angle, this 'inheritance under debt' has its own entity 
        which may sell and purchase, becomes debtor and creditor, and has the 
        characteristics very much similar to those of a 'juridical person.' Not 
        only this, the liability of this 'juridical person' is certainly limited 
        to its existing assets. If the assets do not suffice to settle all the 
        debts, there is no remedy left with its creditors to sue anybody, including 
        the heirs of the deceased, for the rest of their claims. <br>
        <br>
        These are some instances where the Muslim jurists have affirmed a legal 
        entity, similar to that of a juridical person. These examples would show 
        that the concept of 'juridical person' is not totally foreign to the Islamic 
        jurisprudence, and if the juridical entity of a joint-stock company is 
        accepted on the basis of these precedents, no serious objection is likely 
        to be raised against it. <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned earlier, the question of limited liability of a company is 
        closely related to the concept of a 'juridical person'. If a 'juridical 
        person' can be treated a natural person in its rights and obligations, 
        then, every person is liable only to the limit of the assets he owns, 
        and in case he dies insolvent no other person can bear the burden of his 
        remaining liabilities, however closely related to him he may be. On this 
        analogy the limited liability of a joint-stock company may be justified. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Limited Liability of the master of a slave Here I would like to cite 
        another example with advantage, which is the closest example to the limited 
        liability of a joint-stock company. The example relates to a period of 
        our past history when slavery was in vogue, and the slaves were treated 
        as the property of their masters and were freely traded in. Although the 
        institution of slavery with reference to our age is something past and 
        closed, yet the legal principles laid down by our jurists while dealing 
        with various questions pertaining to the trade of slaves are still beneficial 
        to a student of Islamic jurisprudence, and we can avail of those principles 
        while seeking solutions to our modern problems and in this respect, it 
        is believed that this example is the most relevant to the question at 
        issue. The slaves in those days were of two kinds. The first kind was 
        of those who were not permitted by their masters to enter into any commercial 
        transaction. A slave of this kind was called 'Qinn'. But there was another 
        kind of slaves who were allowed by their masters to trade. A slave of 
        this kind was called <img src="arabic_second_limited.gif" width="84" height="51">The 
        initial capital for the purpose of trade was given to such a slave by 
        his master, but he was free to enter into all the commercial transactions. 
        The capital invested by him totally belonged to his master. The income 
        would also vest in him, and whatever the slave earned would go to the 
        master as his exclusive property. If in the course of trade, the slave 
        incurred debts, the same would be set off by the cash and the stock present 
        in the hands of the slave. But if the amount of such cash and stock would 
        not be sufficient to set off the debts, the creditors had a right to sell 
        the slave and settle their claims out of his price. However, if their 
        claims would not be satisfied even after selling the slave, and the slave 
        would die in that state of indebtedness, the creditors could not approach 
        his master for the rest of their claims. <br>
        <br>
        Here, the master was actually the owner of the whole business, the slave 
        being merely an intermediary tool to carry out the business transactions. 
        The slave owned nothing from the business. Still, the liability of the 
        master was limited to the capital he invested including the value of the 
        slave. After the death of the slave, the creditors could not have a claim 
        over the personal assets of the master. <br>
        <br>
        This is the nearest example found in the Islamic Fiqh which is very much 
        similar to the limited liability of the share holders of a company, which 
        can be justified on the same analogy. On the basis of these five precedents, 
        it seems that the concepts of a juridical person and that of limited liability 
        do not contravene any injunction of Islam. But at the same time, it should 
        be emphasized, that the concept of 'limited liability' should not be allowed 
        to work for cheating people and escaping the natural liabilities consequent 
        to a profitable trade. So, the concept could be restricted, to the public 
        companies only who issue their shares to the general public and the number 
        of whose shareholders is so large that each one of them cannot be held 
        responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the business and for the debts 
        exceeding the assets. <br>
        <br>
        As for the private companies or the partnerships, the concept of limited 
        liability should not be applied to them, because, practically, each one 
        of their shareholders and partners can easily acquire a knowledge of the 
        day-to-day affairs of the business and should be held responsible for 
        all its liabilities. There may be an exception for the sleeping partners 
        or the shareholders of a private company who do not take part in the business 
        practically and their liability may be limited as per agreement between 
        the partners. If the sleeping partners have a limited liability under 
        this agreement, it means, in terms of Islamic jurisprudence, that they 
        have not allowed the working partners to incur debts exceeding the value 
        of the assets of the business. In this case, if the debts of the business 
        increase from the specified limit, it will be the sole responsibility 
        of the working partners who have exceeded the limit. <br>
        <br>
        The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that the concept of limited 
        liability can be justified, from the Shari&#145;ah viewpoint, in the public 
        joint-stock companies and those corporate bodies only who issue their 
        shares to general public. The concept may also be applied to the sleeping 
        partners of a firm and to the shareholders of a private company who take 
        no active part in the business management. But the liability of the active 
        partners in a partnership and active shareholders of a private company 
        should always be unlimited. <br>
        At the end, we should again recall what has been pointed out at the outset. 
        The issue of limited liability, being a modern issue which requires a 
        collective effort to find out its solution in the light of Shari&#145;ah, 
        the above discussion should not be deemed to be a final verdict on the 
        subject. This is only the outcome of an initial thinking which always 
        remains subject to further study and research. <br>

        <b> The Performance of the Islamic Banks - A realistic evaluation </b>( 
        <a href="#top">Top</a> ) <a name="performance"></a><br>
        Islamic banking has become today an undeniable reality. The number of 
        Islamic banks and the financial institutions is ever increasing. New Islamic 
        Banks with huge amount of capital are being established. Conventional 
        banks are opening Islamic windows or Islamic subsidiaries for the operations 
        of Islamic banking. Even the non-Muslim financial institutions are entering 
        the field and trying to compete each other to attract as many Muslim customers 
        as they can. It seems that the size of Islamic banking will be at least 
        multiplied during the next decade and the operation of Islamic banks are 
        expected to cover a large area of financial transactions of the world. 
        But before the Islamic financial institutions expand their business they 
        should evaluate their performance during the last two decades because 
        every new system has to learn from the experience of the past, to revise 
        its activities and to analyze its deficiencies in a realistic manner. 
        Unless we analyze our merits and demerits we cannot expect to advance 
        towards our total success. It is in this perspective that we should seek 
        to analyze the operation of Islamic banks and financial institutions in 
        the light of Shariah and to highlight what they have achieved and what 
        they have missed. <br>
        <br>
        Once during a press conference in Malaysia, this author was asked the 
        question about the contribution of the Islamic Banks in promoting the 
        Islamic economy. My reply to the question was apparently contradictory, 
        I said it he has contributed a lot and they have contributed nothing. 
        In the present chapter an attempt has been made to elaborate upon this 
        reply. When it was said that they have contributed a lot, what was meant 
        is that it was a remarkable achievement of the Islamic banks that they 
        have made a great break-through in the present banking system by establishing 
        Islamic financial institutions meant to follow Shariah. It was a cherished 
        dream of the Muslim Ummah to have an interest-free economy, but the concept 
        of Islamic banking was merely a theory discussed in research papers, having 
        no practical example. It was the Islamic banks and financial institutions 
        which translated the theory into practice and presented a living and practical 
        example for the theoretical concept in an environment where it was claimed 
        that no financial institution can work without interest. It was indeed 
        a courageous step on the part of the Islamic banks to come forward with 
        a firm resolution that all their transactions will conform to Shariah 
        and all their activities will be free from all transactions involving 
        interest. <br>
        <br>
        Another major contribution of the Islamic banks is that, being under supervision 
        of their respective Shariah Boards they presented a wide spectrum of questions 
        relating to modern business, to the Shariah scholars, thus providing them 
        with an opportunity not only to understand the contemporary practice of 
        business and trade but also to evaluate it in the light of Shariah and 
        to find out other alternatives which may be acceptable according to the 
        Islamic principles. <br>
        <br>
        It must be understood that when we claim that Islam has a satisfactory 
        solution for every problem emerging in any situation in all times to come, 
        we do not mean that the Holy Quran or the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (SW) 
        or the rulings of the Islamic scholars provide a specific answer to each 
        and every minute detail of our socio-economic life. What we mean is that 
        the Holy Quran and the Holy Sunnah of the Prophet <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">have 
        laid down broad principles in the light of which the scholars of every 
        time have deduced specific answers to the new situation arising in their 
        age. Therefore, in order to reach a definite answer about a new situation 
        the scholars of Shariah have to play a very important role. They have 
        to analyze every new question in the light of the principles laid down 
        by the Holy Quran and Sunnah as well as in the light of the standards 
        set by the earlier jurists, enumerated in the books of Islamic jurisprudence. 
        This exercise is called Istinbat or Ijtihad. It is this exercise which 
        has enriched the Islamic jurisprudence with a wealth of knowledge and 
        wisdom for which no parallel is found in any other religion. In a society 
        where the Shariah is implemented in its full sway the ongoing process 
        of Istinbat keeps injecting new ideas, concepts and rulings into the heritage 
        of Islamic jurisprudence which makes it easier to find out specific answer 
        to almost every situation in the books of Islamic jurisprudence. But during 
        the past few centuries the political decline of the Muslims stopped this 
        process to a considerable extent. Most of the Islamic countries were captured 
        by non-muslim rulers who by enforcing with power the secular system of 
        government, deprived the socio-economic life from the guidance provided 
        by the Shariah, and the Islamic teachings were restricted to a limited 
        sphere of worship, religious education and in some countries to the matter 
        of marriage, divorce and inheritance only. So far as the political and 
        economic activities are concerned the governance of Shariah was totally 
        rejected. <br>
        <br>
        Since the evolution of any legal system depends on its practical application, 
        the evolution of Islamic law with regard to business and trade was hindered 
        by this situation. Almost all the transactions in the market being based 
        on secular concepts were seldom brought to the Shariah scholars for their 
        scrutiny in the light of Shariah. It is true that even in these days some 
        practicing Muslims brought some practical questions before the Shariah 
        scholars for which the scholars have been giving their rulings in the 
        forms of Fatawas of which a substantial collection is still available. 
        However, all these Fatawas related mostly to the individual problems of 
        the relevant persons and addressed their individual needs. <br>
        It is a major contribution of the Islamic banks that, because of their 
        entry into the field of large scale business, the wheel of evolution of 
        Islamic legal system has re-started. Most of the Islamic banks are working 
        under the supervision of their Shariah Boards. They bring their day to 
        day problems before the Shariah scholars who examine them in the light 
        of Islamic rules and principles and give specific rulings about them. 
        This procedure not only makes Shariah scholars more familiar with the 
        new market situation but also through their exercise of Istinbat contributes 
        to the evolution of Islamic jurisprudence. Thus, if a practice is held 
        to be un-islamic by the Shariah scholars a suitable alternative is also 
        sought by the joint efforts of the Shariah scholars and the management 
        of the Islamic banks. The resolutions of the Shariah Boards have by now 
        produced dozens of volumes - a contribution which can never be under-rated. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Another major contribution of the Islamic banks is that they have now 
        asserted themselves in the international market, and Islamic banking as 
        distinguished from conventional banking is being gradually recognized 
        throughout the world. This is how I explain my comment that they have 
        contributed a lot. On the other hand there are a number of deficiencies 
        in the working of the present Islamic banks which should be analyzed with 
        all seriousness. <br>
        First of all, the concept of Islamic banking was based on an economic 
        philosophy underlying the rules and principles of Shariah. In the context 
        of interest-free banking this philosophy aimed at establishing distributive 
        justice free from all sorts of exploitation. As I have explained in a 
        number of articles, the instrument of interest has a constant tendency 
        in favor of the rich and against the interests of the common people. The 
        rich industrialists by borrowing huge amounts from the bank utilize the 
        money of the depositors in their huge profitable projects. After they 
        earn profits, they do not let the depositors share these profits except 
        to the extent of a meager rate of interest and this is also taken by them 
        by adding it to the cost of their products. Therefore, looked at from 
        macro level, they pay nothing to the depositors. While in the extreme 
        cases of losses which lead to their bankruptcy and the consequent bankruptcy 
        of the bank itself, the whole loss is suffered by the depositors. This 
        is how interest creates inequity and imbalance in the distribution of 
        wealth. <br>
        <br>
        Contrary to this is the case of Islamic financing. The ideal instrument 
        of financing according to Shariah is Musharakah where the profits and 
        losses both are shared by both the parties according to equitable proportion. 
        Musharakah provides better opportunities for the depositors to share actual 
        profits earned by the business which in normal cases may be much higher 
        than the rate of interest. Since the profits cannot be determined unless 
        the relevant commodities are completely sold, the profits paid to the 
        depositors cannot be added to the cost of production, therefore, unlike 
        the interest-based system the amount paid to the depositors cannot be 
        claimed back through increase in the prices. <br>
        This philosophy cannot be translated into reality unless the use of the 
        Musharakah is expanded by the Islamic banks. It is true that there are 
        practical problems in using the Musharakah as a mode of financing especially 
        in the present atmosphere where the Islamic banks are working in isolation 
        and, mostly without the support of their respective governments. The fact, 
        however, remains that the Islamic banks should have gressed towards Musharakah 
        in gradual phases and should have increased the size of Musharakah financing. 
        Unfortunately, the Islamic banks have overlooked this basic requirement 
        of Islamic banking and there are no visible efforts to progress towards 
        this transaction even in a gradual manner even on a selective basis. This 
        situation has resulted in a number of adverse factors : <br>
        <br>
        <b> Firstly</b>, the basic philosophy of Islamic banking seems to be totally 
        neglected. <br>
        <b><br>
        Secondly</b>, by ignoring the instrument of Musharakah the Islamic banks 
        are forced to use the instrument of Murabahah and Ijarah and these too, 
        within the framework of the conventional benchmarks like Libber etc. where 
        the net result is not materially different from the interest based transactions. 
        I do not subscribe to the view of those people who do not find any difference 
        between the transactions of conventional banks and Murabahah and Ijarah 
        and who blame the instruments of Murabahah and Ijarah for prepetuating 
        the same business with a different name, because if Murabahah and Ijarah 
        are implemented with their necessary conditions, they have many points 
        of difference which distinguish them from interest-based transactions. 
        However, one cannot deny that these two transactions are not originally 
        modes of financing in Shariah. The Shariah scholars have allowed their 
        use for financing purposes only in those spheres where Musharakah cannot 
        work and that too with certain conditions. This allowance should not be 
        taken as a permanent rule for all sorts of transactions and the entire 
        operations of Islamic Banks should not revolve around it. <br>
        <br>
        <b> Thirdly</b>, when people realize that income from in the transactions 
        undertaken by Islamic banks is dubious akin to the transactions of conventional 
        banks, they become skeptical towards the functioning of Islamic banks. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        Fourthly</b>, if all the transactions of Islamic banks are based on the 
        above devices it becomes very difficult to argue for the case of Islamic 
        banking before the masses especially, before the non-muslims who feel 
        that it is nothing but a matter of twisting of documents only. <br>
        It is observed in a number of Islamic banks that even Murabahah and Ijarah 
        are not effected according to the procedure required by the Shariah. The 
        basic concept of Murabahah was that the bank should purchase the commodity 
        and then sell it to the customer on deferred payment basis at a margin 
        of profit. From the Shariah point of view it is necessary that the commodity 
        should come into the ownership and at least in the constructive possession 
        of the bank before it is sold to the customer. The bank should bear the 
        risk of the commodity during the period it is owned and possessed by the 
        bank. It is observed that many Islamic banks and financial institutions 
        commit a number of mistakes with regard to this transaction: <br>
        <br>
        Some financial institutions have presumed that Murabahah is the substitute 
        for interest, for all practical purposes. Therefore, they contract a Murabahah 
        even when the client wants funds for his overhead expenses like paying 
        salaries or bills for the goods and services already consumed. Obviously 
        Murabahah cannot be effected in this case because no commodity is being 
        purchased by the bank. <br>
        <br>
        In some cases the client purchases the commodity on his own prior to any 
        agreement with the Islamic Bank and a Murabahah is effected on a buy-back 
        basis. This is again contrary to the Islamic principles because the buy-back 
        arrangement is unanimously held as prohibited in Shariah. <br>
        <br>
        In some cases the client himself is made an agent for the bank to purchase 
        a commodity and to sell it to himself immediately after acquiring the 
        commodity. This is not in accordance with the basic conditions of the 
        permissibility of Murabahah. If the client himself is made an agent to 
        purchase the commodity, his capacity as an agent must be distinguished 
        from his capacity as a buyer which means that after purchasing commodity 
        on behalf of the bank he must inform the bank that he has effected the 
        purchase on its behalf and then the commodity should be sold to him by 
        the bank through a proper offer and acceptance which may be effected through 
        the exchange of telexes or faxes. <br>
        <br>
        As explained earlier Murabahah is a kind of sale and it is an established 
        principle of Shariah that the price must be determined at the time of 
        sale. This price can neither be increased nor reduced unilaterally once 
        it is fixed by the parties. It is observed that some financial institutions 
        increase the price of Murabahah in the case of late payment which is not 
        allowed in Shariah. Some financial institutions roll-over the Murabahah 
        in the case of default by the client. Obviously, this practice is not 
        warranted by Shariah because once the commodity is sold to the customer 
        it cannot be the subject matter of another sale to the same customer. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In transactions of Ijarah also some requirements of Shariah are often 
        overlooked. It is a prerequisite for a valid Ijarah that the lessor bears 
        the risks related to the ownership of the leased asset and that the usufruct 
        of the leased asset must be made available to the lessee for which he 
        pays rent. It is observed in a number of Ijarah agreements that these 
        rules are violated. Even in the case of destruction of the asset due to 
        force majeure, the lessee is required to keep paying the rent which means 
        that the lessor neither assumes the liability for his ownership nor offers 
        any usufruct to the lessee. This type of Ijarah is against the basic principles 
        of Shariah. <br>
        <br>
        The Islamic banking is based on principles different from those followed 
        in conventional banking system. It is therefore logical that the results 
        of their operations are not necessarily the same in terms of profitability. 
        An Islamic bank may earn more in some cases and may earn less in some 
        others. If our target is always to match the conventional banks in terms 
        of profits, we can hardly develop our own products based on pure Islamic 
        principles. Unless the sponsors of the bank as well as its management 
        and its clientele realize this fact and are ready to accept different 
        - but not necessarily adverse - results, the Islamic banks will keep using 
        artificial devices and a true Islamic system will not come into being. 
        <br>
        <br>
        According to the Islamic principles, business transactions can never be 
        separated from the moral objectives of the society. Therefore, Islamic 
        banks were supposed to adopt new financing policies and to explore new 
        channels of investments which may encourage development and support the 
        small scale traders to lift up their economic level. A very few Islamic 
        banks and financial institutions have paid attention to this aspect. Unlike 
        the conventional financial institutions who strive for nothing but making 
        enormous profits, the Islamic banks should have taken the fulfillment 
        of the needs of the society as one of their major objectives and should 
        have given preference to the products which may help the common people 
        to raise their standard of living. They should have invented new schemes 
        for house-financing, vehicle-financing and rehabilitation-financing for 
        the small traders. This area still awaits attention of the Islamic banks. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The case of Islamic banking cannot be advanced unless a strong system 
        of inter-bank transactions based on Islamic principles is developed. The 
        lack of such a system forces the Islamic banks to turn to the conventional 
        banks for their short term needs of liquidity which the conventional banks 
        do not provide without either an open or camouflaged interest. The creation 
        of an inter-bank relationship based on Islamic principles should no longer 
        be deemed difficult. The number of Islamic financial institutions today 
        has reached around two hundred. They can create a fund with a mixture 
        of Murabahah and Ijarah instruments the units of which can be used even 
        for overnight transactions. If they develop such a fund it may solve a 
        number of problems. <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, the Islamic banks should develop their own culture. Obviously, 
        Islam is not restricted to the banking transactions. It is a set of rules 
        and principles governing the whole human life. Therefore, for being 'Islamic' 
        it is not sufficient to design the transactions on Islamic principles. 
        It is also necessary that the outlook of the institution and its staff 
        reflects the Islamic identity quite distinguished from the conventional 
        institution. This requires a major change in the general attitude of the 
        institution and its management. Islamic obligations of worship as well 
        as the ethical norms must be prominent in the whole atmosphere of an institution 
        which claims to be Islamic. This is an area in which some Islamic institutions 
        in the Middle East have made progress. However, it should be a distinguishing 
        feature of all the Islamic banks and financial institutions throughout 
        the world. The guidance of Shariah Boards should be sought in this area 
        also. <br>
        <br>
        The purpose of this discussion, as clarified at the outset, is by no means 
        to discourage the Islamic Banks or to find faults with them. The only 
        purpose is to persuade them to evaluate their own performance from the 
        Shariah point of view and to adopt a realistic approach while designing 
        their procedure and determining their policies.<br>
