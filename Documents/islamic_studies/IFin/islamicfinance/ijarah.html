        <a name="intro"></a>Introduction</b><br>
        &quot;Ijarah&quot; is a term of Islamic fiqh. Lexically, it means 'to 
        give something on rent'. In the Islamic jurisprudence, the term 'Ijarah' 
        is used for two different situations. In the first place, it means 'to 
        employ the services of a person on wages given to him as a consideration 
        for his hired services.&quot; The employer is called 'musta&#146;jir' 
        while the employee is called 'ajir'. <br>
        Therefore, if A has employed B in his office as a manager or as a clerk 
        on a monthly salary, A is musta&#146;jir, and B is an ajir. Similarly, 
        if A has hired the services of a porter to carry his baggage to the airport, 
        A is a musta&#146;jir while the porter is an ajir, and in both cases the 
        transaction between the parties is termed as Ijarah. This type of Ijarah 
        includes every transaction where the services of a person are hired by 
        someone else. He may be a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a laborer or any 
        other person who can render some valuable services. Each one of them may 
        be called an 'ajir' according to the terminology of Islamic law, and the 
        person who hires their services is called a 'musta&#146;jir', while the 
        wages paid to the ajir are called their 'ujrah'. Labor <br>
        <br>
        The second type of Ijarah relates to the usufructs of assets and properties, 
        and not to the services of human beings. 'Ijarah' in this sense means 
        'to transfer the usufruct of a particular property to another person in 
        exchange for a rent claimed from him.' In this case, the term 'Ijarah' 
        is analogous to the English term 'leasing'. Here the lessor is called 
        'Mu&#146;jir', the lessee is called 'musta&#146;jir' and the rent payable 
        to the lessor is called 'ujrah'. <br>
        <br>
        Both these kinds of 'Ijarah' are thoroughly discussed in the literature 
        of Islamic jurisprudence and each one of them has its own set of rules. 
        But for the purpose of the present book, the second type of Ijarah is 
        more relevant, because it is generally used as a form of investment, and 
        as a mode of financing also. <br>
        <br>
        The rules of Ijarah, in the sense of leasing, is very much analogous to 
        the rules of sale, because in both cases something is transferred to another 
        person for a valuable consideration. The only difference between Ijarah 
        and sale is that in the latter case the corpus of the property is transferred 
        to the purchaser, while in the case of Ijarah, the corpus of the property 
        remains in the ownership of the transferor, but only its usufruct i.e. 
        the right to use it, is transferred to the lessee. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, it can easily be seen that 'Ijarah' is not a mode of financing 
        in its origin. It is a normal business activity like sale. However, due 
        to certain reasons, and in particular, due to some tax concessions it 
        may carry, this transaction is being used in the Western countries for 
        the purpose of financing also. Instead of giving a simple interest - bearing 
        loan, some financial institutions started leasing some equipment&#146;s 
        to their customers. While fixing the rent of these equipment, they calculate 
        the total cost they have incurred in the purchase of these assets and 
        add the stipulated interest they could have claimed on such an amount 
        during the lease period. The aggregate amount so calculated is divided 
        on the total months of the lease period, and the monthly rent is fixed 
        on that basis. <br>
        <br>
        The question whether or not the transaction of leasing can be used as 
        a mode of financing in Shari&#145;ah depends on the terms and conditions 
        of the contract. As mentioned earlier, leasing is a normal business transaction 
        and not a mode of financing. Therefore, the lease transaction is always 
        governed by the rules of Shari&#145;ah prescribed for Ijarah. Let us, 
        therefore, discuss the basic rules governing the lease transactions, as 
        enumerated in the Islamic Fiqh. After the study of these rules, we will 
        be able to understand under what conditions the Ijarah may be used for 
        the purpose of financing. <br>
        <br>
        Although the principles of Ijarah are so numerous that a separate volume 
        is required for their full discussion, we will attempt in this chapter 
        to summarize those basic principles only which are necessary for the proper 
        understanding of the nature of the transaction and are generally needed 
        in the context of modern economic practice. These principles are recorded 
        here in the form of brief notes, so that the readers may use them for 
        quick reference. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="basic"></a><b>Basic Rules of Leasing</b> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        <b><br>
        1.</b> Leasing is a contract whereby the owner of something transfers 
        its usufruct to another person for an agreed period, at an agreed consideration. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        2.</b> The subject of lease must have a valuable use. Therefore, things 
        having no usufruct at all cannot be leased. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 3.</b> It is necessary for a valid contract of lease that the corpus 
        of the leased property remains in the ownership of the seller, and only 
        its usufruct is transferred to the lessee. Thus, anything which cannot 
        be used without consuming cannot be leased out. Therefore, the lease cannot 
        be effected in respect of money, eatables, fuel and ammunition etc. because 
        their use is not possible unless they are consumed. If anything of this 
        nature is leased out, it will be deemed to be a loan and all the rules 
        concerning the transaction of loan shall accordingly apply. Any rent charged 
        on this invalid lease shall be an interest charged on a loan. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 4.</b> As the corpus of the leased property remains in the ownership 
        of the lessor, all the liabilities emerging from the ownership shall be 
        borne by the lessor, but the liabilities referable to the use of the property 
        shall be borne by the lessee. <br>
        <b>Example:</b><br>
        <b> A</b> has leased his house to <b>B</b>. The taxes referable to the 
        property shall be borne by A, while the water tax, electricity bills and 
        all expenses referable to the use of the house shall be borne by B, the 
        lessee. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 5.</b> The period of lease must be determined in clear terms. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 6.</b> The lessee cannot use the leased asset for any purpose other 
        than the purpose specified in the lease agreement. If no such purpose 
        is specified in the agreement, the lessee can use it for whatever purpose 
        it is used in the normal course. However if he wishes to use it for an 
        abnormal purpose, he cannot do so unless the lessor allows him in express 
        terms. <br>
        <b><br>
        7.</b> The lessee is liable to compensate the lessor for every harm to 
        the leased asset caused by any misuse or negligence on the part of the 
        lessee. <br>
        <b><br>
        8.</b> The leased asset shall remain in the risk of the lessor throughout 
        the lease period in the sense that any harm or loss caused by the factors 
        beyond the control of the lessee shall be borne by the lessor. <br>
        <b><br>
        9.</b> A property jointly owned by two or more persons can be leased out, 
        and the rental shall be distributed between all the joint owners according 
        to the proportion of their respective shares in the property. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 10.</b> A joint owner of a property can lease his proportionate share 
        to his co-sharer only, and not to any other person. <br>
        <b><br>
        11</b>. It is necessary for a valid lease that the leased asset is fully 
        identified by the parties. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example</b>:<br>
        A said to B. &quot;I lease you one of my two shops.&quot; B agreed. The 
        lease is void, unless the leased shop is clearly determined and identified. 
        <br>
        Determination of Rental <br>
        <br>
        <b> 12.</b> The rental must be determined at the time of contract for 
        the whole period of lease. <br>
        It is permissible that different amounts of rent are fixed for different 
        phases during the lease period, provided that the amount of rent for each 
        phase is specifically agreed upon at the time of effecting a lease. If 
        the rent for a subsequent phase of the lease period has not been determined 
        or has been left at the option of the lessor, the lease is not valid. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        Example (1)</b> :<br>
        A leases his house to B for a total period of 5 years. The rent for the 
        first year is fixed as Rs. 2000/- per month and it is agreed that the 
        rent of every subsequent year shall be 10% more than the previous one. 
        The lease is valid. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example (2)</b>: In the above example, A puts a condition in the agreement 
        that the rent of Rs. 2000/- per month is fixed for the first year only. 
        The rent for the subsequent years shall be fixed each year at the option 
        of the lessor. The lease is void, because the rent is uncertain. <br>
        The determination of rental on the basis of the aggregate cost incurred 
        in the purchase of the asset by the lessor, as normally done in financial 
        leases, is not against the rules of Shari&#145;ah, if both parties agree 
        to it, provided that all other conditions of a valid lease prescribed 
        by the Shari&#145;ah are fully adhered to. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 14.</b> The lessor cannot increase the rent unilaterally, and any 
        agreement to to this effect is void. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 15.</b> The rent or any part thereof may be payable in advance before 
        the delivery of the asset to the lessee, but the amount so collected by 
        the lessor shall remain with him as 'on account' payment and shall be 
        adjusted towards the rent after its being due. <br>
        <b><br>
        16.</b> The lease period shall commence from the date on which the leased 
        asset has been delivered to the lessee, no matter whether the lessee has 
        started using it or not. <br>
        <b><br>
        17.</b> If the leased asset has totally lost the function for which it 
        was leased, and no repair is possible, the lease shall terminate on the 
        day on which such loss has been caused. However, if the loss is caused 
        by the misuse or by the negligence of the lessee, he will be liable to 
        compensate the lessor for the depreciated value of the asset as, it was 
        immediately before the loss. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="lease"></a> Lease as a mode of financing </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        Like murabahah, lease is not originally a mode of financing. It is simply 
        a transaction meant to transfer the usufruct of a property from one person 
        to another for an agreed period against an agreed consideration. However, 
        certain financial institutions have adopted leasing as a mode of financing 
        instead of long term lending on the basis of interest. This kind of lease 
        is generally known as the 'financial lease' as distinguished from the 
        'operating lease' and many basic features of actual leasing transaction 
        have been dispensed with therein. <br>
        When interest-free financial institutions were established in the near 
        past, they found that leasing is a recognized mode of finance throughout 
        the world. On the other hand, they realized that leasing is a lawful transaction 
        according to Shari&#145;ah and it can be used as an interest-free mode 
        of financing. Therefore, leasing has been adopted by the Islamic financial 
        institutions, but very few of them paid attention to the fact that the 
        'financial lease' has a number of characteristics more similar to interest 
        than to the actual lease transaction. That is why they started using the 
        same model agreements of leasing as were in vogue among the conventional 
        financial institutions without any modification, while a number of their 
        provisions were not in conformity with Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned earlier, leasing is not a mode of financing in its origin. 
        However, the transaction may be used for financing, subject to certain 
        conditions. It is not sufficient for this purpose to substitute the name 
        of 'interest' by the name of 'rent' and replace the name of 'mortgage' 
        by the name of 'leased asset'. There must be a substantial difference 
        between leasing and an interest-bearing loan. That will be possible only 
        by following all the Islamic rules of leasing, some of which have been 
        mentioned in the first part of this chapter. <br>
        To be more specific, some basic differences between the contemporary financial 
        leasing and the actual leasing allowed by the Shari&#145;ah are indicated 
        below. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="commencement"></a>The commencement of lease </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        1. Unlike the contract of sale, the agreement of Ijarah can be effected 
        for a future date.1 Thus, while a forward sale is not allowed in Shari&#145;ah, 
        an 'Ijarah' for a future date is allowed, on the condition that the rent 
        will be payable only after the leased asset is delivered to the lessee. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In most cases of the 'financial lease' the lessor i.e. the financial institution 
        purchases the asset through the lessee himself. The lessee purchases the 
        asset on behalf of the lessor who pays its price to the supplier, either 
        directly or through the lessee. In some lease agreements, the lease commences 
        on the very day on which the price is paid by the lessor, irrespective 
        of whether the lessee has effected payment to the supplier and taken delivery 
        of the asset or not. It may mean that lessee's liability for the rent 
        starts before the lessee takes delivery of the asset. This is not allowed 
        in Shari&#145;ah, because it amounts to charging rent on the money given 
        to the customer which is nothing but interest, pure and simple. <br>
        The correct way, according to Shari&#145;ah, is that the rent be charged 
        after the lessee has taken delivery of the asset, and not from the day 
        the price has been paid. If the supplier has delayed the delivery after 
        receiving the full price, the lessee should not be liable for the rent 
        of the period of delay. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="different"></a>Different relations of the parties </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        ) <br>
        It should be clearly understood that when the lessee himself has been 
        entrusted with the purchase of the asset intended to be leased, there 
        are two separate relations between the institution and the client which 
        come into operation one after the other. In the first instance, the client 
        is an agent of the institution to purchase the asset on latter's behalf. 
        At this stage, the relation between the parties is nothing more than the 
        relation of a principal and his agent. The relation of lessor and lessee 
        has not yet come into operation. <br>
        <br>
        The second stage begins from the date when the client takes delivery from 
        the supplier. At this stage, the relation of lessor and lessee comes to 
        play its role. These two capacities of the parties should not be mixed 
        up or confused with each other. During the first stage, the client cannot 
        be held liable for the obligations of a lessee. In this period, he is 
        responsible to carry out the functions of an agent only. But when the 
        asset is delivered to him, he is liable to discharge his obligations as 
        a lessee. <br>
        <br>
        However, there is a point of difference between murabahah and leasing. 
        In murabahah, as mentioned earlier, actual sale should take place after 
        the client takes delivery from the supplier, and the previous agreement 
        of murabahah is not enough for effecting the actual sale. Therefore, after 
        taking possession of the asset as an agent, he is bound to give intimation 
        to the institution, and make an offer for the purchase from him. The sale 
        takes place after the institution accepts the offer. <br>
        <br>
        The procedure in leasing is different, and a little shorter. Here the 
        parties need not effect the lease contract after taking delivery. If the 
        institution, while appointing the client its agent, has agreed to lease 
        the asset with effect from the date of delivery, the lease will automatically 
        start on that date without any additional procedure. There are two reasons 
        for this difference between murabahah and leasing: <br>
        <b><br>
        Firstly</b>, it is a necessary condition for a valid sale that it should 
        be effected instantly. Thus, a sale attributed to a future date is invalid 
        in Shari&#145;ah. But leasing can be attributed to a future date. Therefore, 
        the previous agreement is not sufficient in the case of murabahah, while 
        it is quite enough in the case of leasing. <br>
        <br>
        <b> Secondly</b>, the basic principle of Shari&#145;ah is that one cannot 
        claim a profit or a fee for a property the risk of which was never borne 
        by him. Applying this principle to murabahah, the seller cannot claim 
        a profit over a property which never remained under his risk for a moment. 
        Therefore, if the previous agreement is held to be sufficient for effecting 
        a sale between the client and the institution, the asset shall be transferred 
        to the client simultaneously when he takes its possession, and the asset 
        shall not come into the risk of the seller even for a moment. That is 
        why the simultaneous transfer is not possible in murabahah, and there 
        should be a fresh offer and acceptance after the delivery. <br>
        In leasing, however, the asset remains under the risk and ownership of 
        the lessor throughout the leasing period, because the ownership has not 
        been transferred. Therefore, if the lease period begins right from the 
        time when the client has taken delivery, it does not violate the principle 
        mentioned above. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="expenses"></a>Expenses consequent to ownership </b>( <a href="#top">Top 
        </a>)<br>
        As the lessor is the owner of the asset, and he has purchased it from 
        the supplier through his agent, he is liable to pay all the expenses incurred 
        in the process of its purchase and its import to the country of the lessor. 
        Consequently, he is liable to pay the freight and the customs duty etc. 
        He can, of course, include all these expenses in his cost and can take 
        them into consideration while fixing the rentals, but as a matter of principle, 
        he is liable to bear all these expenses as the owner of the asset. Any 
        agreement to the contrary, as is found in the traditional financial leases, 
        is not in conformity with Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        Liability of the parties in case of loss to the asset <br>
        <br>
        As mentioned in the basic principles of leasing, the lessee is responsible 
        for any loss caused to the asset by his misuse or negligence. He can also 
        be made liable to the wear and tear which normally occurs during its use. 
        But he cannot be made liable to a loss caused by the factors beyond his 
        control. The agreements of the traditional 'financial lease' generally 
        do not differentiate between the two situations. In a lease based on the 
        Islamic principles, both the situations should be dealt with separately.

      <p align="justify"><b><a name="vairable"></a>Variable Rentals in Long Term Leases </b>( 
        <a href="#top">Top </a>)<br>
        In the long term lease agreements it is mostly not in the benefit of the 
        lessor to fix one amount of rent for the whole period of lease, because 
        the market conditions change from time to time. <br>
        In this case the lessor has two options: <br>
        <b><br>
        (a)</b> He can contract lease with a condition that the rent shall be 
        increased according to a specified proportion (e.g. 5%) after a specified 
        period (like one year). <br>
        <b><br>
        (b)</b> He can contract lease for a shorter period after which the parties 
        can renew the lease at new terms and by mutual consent, with full liberty 
        to each one of them to refuse the renewal, in which case the lessee is 
        bound to vacate the leased property and return it back to the lessor. 
        <br>
        <br>
        These two options are available to the lessor according to the classical 
        rules of Islamic Fiqh. However, some contemporary scholars have allowed, 
        in long-term leases, to tie up the rental amount with a variable benchmark 
        which is so well-known and well-defined that it does not leave room for 
        any dispute. For example, it is permissible according to them to provide 
        in the lease contract that in case of any increase in the taxes imposed 
        by the government on the lessor, the rent will be increased to the extent 
        of same amount. Similarly it is allowed by them that the annual increase 
        in the rent is tied up with the rate of inflation. Therefore if there 
        is an increase of 5% in the rate of inflation, it will result in an increase 
        of 5% in the rent as well. Based on the same principle, some Islamic banks 
        use the rate of interest as a benchmark to determine the rental amounts. 
        They want to earn the same profit through leasing as is earned by the 
        conventional banks through advancing loans on the basis of interest. Therefore, 
        they want to tie up the rentals with the rate of interest and instead 
        of fixing a definite amount of rental, they calculate the cost of purchasing 
        the lease assets and want to earn through rentals an amount equal to the 
        rate of interest. Therefore, the agreement provides that the rental will 
        be equal to the rate of interest or to the rate of interest plus something. 
        Since the rate of interest is variable, it cannot be determined for the 
        whole lease period. Therefore, these contracts use the interest rate of 
        a particular country (like LIBOR) as a benchmark for determining the periodical 
        increase in the rent. <br>
        <br>
        This arrangement has been criticized on two grounds: <br>
        The first objection raised against it is that, by subjecting the rental 
        payments to the rate of interest, the transaction is rendered akin to 
        an interest based financing. This objection can be overcome by saying 
        that, as fully discussed in the case of murabahah, the rate of interest 
        is used as a benchmark only. So far as other requirements of Shari&#145;ah 
        for a valid lease are properly fulfilled, the contract may use any benchmark 
        for determining the amount of rental. The basic difference between an 
        interest - based financing and a valid lease does not lie in the amount 
        to be paid to the financier or the lessor. The basic difference is that 
        in the case of lease, the lessor assumes the full risk of the corpus of 
        the leased asset. If the asset is destroyed during the lease period, the 
        lessor will suffer the loss. Similarly, if the leased asset looses its 
        usufruct without any misuse or negligence on the part of the lessee, the 
        lessor cannot claim the rent, while in the case of an interest-based financing, 
        the financier is entitled to receive interest, even if the debtor did 
        not at all benefit from the money borrowed. So far as this basic difference 
        is maintained, (i.e. the lessor assumes the risk of the leased asset) 
        the transaction cannot be categorised as an interest-bearing transaction, 
        even though the amount of rent claimed from the lessee is equal to the 
        rate of interest. <br>
        It is thus clear that the use of the rate of interest merely as a benchmark 
        does not render the contract invalid as an interest - based transaction. 
        It is, however, advisable at all times to avoid using interest even as 
        a benchmark, so that an Islamic transaction is totally distinguished from 
        an un-Islamic one, having no resemblance of interest whatsoever. <br>
        The second objection to this arrangement is that the variations of the 
        rate of interest being unknown, the rental tied up with the rate of interest 
        will imply Jahalah and Gharar which is not permissible in Shari&#145;ah. 
        It is one of the basic requirements of Shari&#145;ah that the consideration 
        in every contract must be known to the parties when they enter into it. 
        The consideration in a transaction of lease is the rent charged from the 
        lessee, and therefore it must be known to each party right at the beginning 
        of the contract of lease. If we tie up the rental with the future rate 
        of interest, which is unknown, the amount of rent will remain unknown 
        as well. This is the Jahalah or Gharar which renders the transaction invalid. 
        <br>
        Responding to this objection, one may say that the Jahalah has been prohibited 
        for two reasons: One reason is that it may lead to dispute between the 
        parties. This reason is not applicable here, because both parties have 
        agreed with mutual consent upon a well defined benchmark that will serve 
        as a criterion for determining the rent, and whatever amount is determined, 
        based on this benchmark, will be acceptable to both parties. Therefore, 
        there is no question of any dispute between them. <br>
        <br>
        The Second reason for the prohibition of Jahalah is that it renders the 
        parties susceptible to an unforeseen loss. It is possible that the rate 
        of interest, in a particular period, zooms up to an unexpected level in 
        which case the lessee will suffer. It is equally possible that the rate 
        of interest zooms down to an unexpected level, in which case the lessor 
        may suffer. In order to meet the risks involved in such possibilities, 
        it is suggested by some contemporary scholars that the relation between 
        rent and the rate of interest is subjected to a limit or ceiling. For 
        example, it may be provided in the base contract that the rental amount 
        after a given period, will be changed according to the change in the rate 
        of interest, but it will in no case be higher than 15% or lower than 5% 
        of the previous monthly rent. It will mean that if the increase in the 
        rate of interest is more than 15% the rent will be increased only up to 
        15%. Conversely, if the decrease in the rate of interest is more than 
        5% the rent will not be decreased to more than 5%. In our opinion, this 
        is the moderate view which takes care of all the aspects involved in the 
        issue. <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="penalty"></a> Penalty for Late Payment of Rent </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        In some agreements of financial leases, a penalty is imposed on the lessee 
        in case he delays the payment of rent after the due date. This penalty, 
        if meant to add to the income of the lessor, is not warranted by the Shari&#145;ah. 
        The reason is that the rent after it becomes due, is a debt payable by 
        the lessee, and is subject to all the rules prescribed for a debt. A monetary 
        charge from a debtor for his late payment is exactly the riba prohibited 
        by the Holy Qur&#146;an. Therefore, the lessor cannot charge an additional 
        amount in case the lessee delays payment of the rent. <br>
        <br>
        However, in order to avoid the adverse consequences resulting from the 
        misuse of this prohibition, another alternative may be resorted to. The 
        lessee may be asked to undertake that, if he fails to pay rent on its 
        due date, he will pay certain amount to a charity. For this purpose the 
        financier / lessor may maintain a charity fund where such amounts may 
        be credited and disbursed for charitable purposes, including advancing 
        interest-free loans to the needy persons. The amount payable for charitable 
        purposes by the lessee may vary according to the period of default and 
        may be calculated at per cent, per annum basis . The agreement of the 
        lease may contain the following clause for this purpose: <br>
        <br>
        &quot;The Lessee hereby undertakes that, if he fails to pay rent at its 
        due date, he shall pay an amount calculated at ....% p.a. to the charity 
        Fund maintained by the Lessor which will be used by the Lessor exclusively 
        for charitable purposes approved by the Shari&#145;ah and shall in no 
        case form part of the income of the Lessor.&quot; <br>
        This arrangement, though does not compensate the lessor for his opportunity 
        cost of the period of default, yet it may serve as a strong deterrent 
        for the lessee to pay the rent promptly. <br>
        <br>
        The justification for such undertaking of the lessee, and inability of 
        any penalty or compensation claimed by the lessor for his own benefit 
        is discussed in full in the chapter of 'Murabahah' in the present book 
        which may be consulted for details. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="termination"></a>Termination of lease </b>( <a href="#top">Top 
        </a>)<br>
        If the lessee contravenes any term of the agreement, the lessor has a 
        right to terminate the lease contract unilaterally. However, if there 
        is no contravention on the part of the lessee, the lease cannot be terminated 
        without mutual consent. In some agreements of the 'financial lease' it 
        has been noticed that the lessor has been given an unrestricted power 
        to terminate the lease unilaterally whenever he wishes, according to his 
        sole judgment. This is again contrary to the principles of Shari&#145;ah. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In some agreements of the 'financial lease' a condition has been found 
        to the effect that in case of the termination of lease, even at the option 
        of the lessor, the rent of the remaining lease period shall be paid by 
        the lessee. This condition is obviously against Shari&#145;ah and the 
        principles of equity and justice. The basic reason for inserting such 
        conditions in the agreement of lease is that the main concept behind the 
        agreement is to give an interest-bearing loan under the ostensible cover 
        of lease. That is why every effort is made to avoid the logical consequences 
        of the lease contract. <br>
        <br>
        Naturally, such a condition cannot be acceptable to Shari&#145;ah. The 
        logical consequence of the termination of lease is that the asset should 
        be taken back by the lessor. The lessee should be asked to pay the rent 
        as due up to the date of termination. If the termination has been effected 
        due to the misuse or negligence on the part of the lessee, he can also 
        be asked to compensate the lessor for the loss caused by such misuse or 
        negligence. But he cannot be compelled to pay the rent of the remaining 
        period. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="insurance"></a>Insurance of the assets </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        If the leased property is insured under the Islamic mode of takaful, it 
        should be at the expense of the lessor and not at the expense of the lessee, 
        as is generally provided in the agreements of the current 'financial leases'. 
        <br>
        The residual value of the leased asset <br>
        <br>
        Another important feature of the modern 'financial leases' is that after 
        the expiry of the lease period, the corpus of the leased asset is normally 
        transferred to the lessee. As the lessor already recovers his cost along 
        with an additional profit thereon, which is normally equal to the amount 
        of interest which could have been earned on a loan of that amount advanced 
        for that period, the lessor has no further interest in the leased asset. 
        On the other hand, the lessee wants to retain the asset after the expiry 
        of the leased period. <br>
        <br>
        For these reasons, the leased asset is generally transferred to the lessee 
        at the end of the lease, either free of any charge or at a nominal token 
        price. In order to ensure that the asset will be transferred to the lessee, 
        sometimes the lease contract has an express clause to this effect. Sometimes 
        this condition is not mentioned in the contract expressly; however, it 
        is understood between the parties that the title of the asset will be 
        passed on to the lessee at the end of the lease term. <br>
        <br>
        This condition, whether it is express or implied, is not in accordance 
        with the principles of Shari&#145;ah. It is a well settled rule of Islamic 
        jurisprudence that one transaction cannot be tied up with another transaction 
        so as to make the former a pre-condition for the other. Here the transfer 
        of the asset at the end has been made a necessary condition for the transaction 
        of lease which is not allowed in Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        <br>
        The original position in Shari&#145;ah is that the asset shall be the 
        sole property of the lessor, and after the expiry of the lease period, 
        the lessor shall be at liberty to take the asset back, or to renew the 
        lease or to lease it out to another party, or sell it to the lessee or 
        to any other person. The lessee cannot force him to sell it to him at 
        a nominal price, nor can such a condition be imposed on the lessor in 
        the lease agreement. <br>
        <br>
        But after the lease period expires, and the lessor wants to give the asset 
        to the lessee as a gift or to sell it to him, he can do so by his free 
        will. However, some contemporary scholars, keeping in view the needs of 
        the Islamic financial institutions have come up with an alternative. They 
        say that the agreement of Ijarah itself should not contain a condition 
        of gift or sale at the end of the lease period. However, the lessor may 
        enter into a unilateral promise to sell the leased asset to the lessee 
        at the end of the lease period. This promise will be binding on the lessor 
        only. The principle, according to them, is that a unilateral promise to 
        enter into a contract at a future date is allowed whereby the promisor 
        is bound to fulfil the promise, but the promisee is not bound to enter 
        into that contract . It means that he has an option to purchase which 
        he may or may not exercise. However, if he wants to exercise his option 
        to purchase, the promisor cannot refuse it because he is bound by his 
        promise. Therefore, these scholars suggest that the lessor, after entering 
        into the lease agreement, can sign a separate unilateral promise whereby 
        he undertakes that if the lessee has paid all the amounts of rentals and 
        wants to purchase the asset at a specified mutually acceptable price, 
        he will sell the leased asset to him for that price. <br>
        <br>
        Once this promise is signed by the lessor, he is bound to fulfil it and 
        the lessee may exercise his option to purchase at the end of the period, 
        if he has fully paid the amounts of rent according to the agreement of 
        lease. Similarly, it is also allowed by these scholars that, instead of 
        sale, the lessor signs a separate promise to gift the leased asset to 
        the lessee at the end of the lease period, subject to his payment of all 
        amounts of rent. This arrangement is called 'Ijarah wa iqtina&#146;. It 
        has been allowed by a large number of contemporary scholars and is widely 
        acted upon by the Islamic banks and financial institutions. The validity 
        of this arrangement is subject to two basic conditions: <br>
        <br>
        Firstly, the agreement of Ijarah itself should not be subjected to signing 
        this promise of sale or gift but the promise should he recorded in a separate 
        document. <br>
        Secondly, the promise should be unilateral and binding on the promisor 
        only. It should not be a bilateral promise binding on both parties because 
        in this case it will be a full contract effected to a future date which 
        is not allowed in the case of sale or gift. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="sublease"></a> <b>Sub-Lease </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        If the leased asset is used differently by different users, the lessee 
        cannot sub-lease the leased asset except with the express permission of 
        the lessor. If the lessor permits the lessee for subleasing, he may sub-lease 
        it. If the rent claimed from the sub-lessee is equal to or less than the 
        rent payable to the owner / original lessor, all the recognized schools 
        of Islamic jurisprudence are unanimous on the permissibility of the sub 
        lease. However, the opinions are different in case the rent charged from 
        the sub-lessee is higher than the rent payable to the owner. Imam al-Shafi&#145;i 
        and some other scholars allow it and hold that the sub lessor may enjoy 
        the surplus received from the sub-lessee. This is the preferred view in 
        the Hanbali school as well. On the other hand. Imam Abu Hanifah is of 
        the view that the surplus received from the sub-lessee in this case is 
        not permissible for the sub-lessor to keep and he will have to give that 
        surplus in charity. However, if the sub-lessor has developed the leased 
        property by adding something to it or has rented it in a currency different 
        from the currency in which he himself pays rent to the owner/the original 
        lessor, he can claim a higher rent from his sub-lessee and can enjoy the 
        surplus. <br>
        <br>
        Although the view of Imam Abu Hanifah is more precautions which should 
        be acted upon to the best possible extent, in cases of need the view of 
        Shafi&#145;i and Hanbali schools may be followed because there is no express 
        prohibition in the Holy Qur&#146;an or in the Sunnah against the surplus 
        claimed from the lessee. Ibn Qudamah has argued for the permissibility 
        of surplus on forceful grounds. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="assinging"></a>Assigning of the Lease </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        ) <br>
        The lessor can sell the leased property to a third party whereby the relation 
        of lessor and lessee shall be established between the new owner and the 
        lessee. However, the assigning of the lease itself (without assigning 
        the ownership in the leased asset) for a monetary consideration is not 
        permissible. <br>
        <br>
        The difference between the two situations is that in the latter case the 
        ownership of the asset is not transferred to the assignee, but he becomes 
        entitled to receive the rent of the asset only. This kind of assignment 
        is allowed in Shari&#145;ah only where no monetary consideration is charged 
        from the assignee for this assignment. for example, a lessor can assign 
        his right to claim rent from the lessee to his son, or to his friend in 
        the form of a gift. Similarly, he can assign this right to any one of 
        his creditors to set off his debt out of the rentals received by him. 
        But if the lessor wants to sell this right for a fixed price, it is not 
        permissible, because in this case the money (the amount of rentals) is 
        sold for money which is a transaction subject to the principle of equality. 
        Otherwise it will be tantamount to a riba transaction, hence prohibited. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="securization"></a>Securitization of Ijarah </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        ) <br>
        The arrangement of Ijarah has a good potential of securitization which 
        may help create a secondary market for the financiers on the basis of 
        Ijarah. Since the lessor in Ijarah owns the leased assets, he can sell 
        the asset, in whole or in part, to a third party who may purchase it and 
        may replace the seller in the rights and obligations of the lessor with 
        regard to the purchased part of the asset. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, if the lessor, after entering into Ijarah, wishes to recover 
        his cost of purchase of the asset with a profit thereon, he can sell the 
        leased asset wholly or partly either to one party or to a number of individuals. 
        In the latter case, the purchase of a proportion of the asset by each 
        individual may be evidenced by a certificate which may be called 'Ijarah 
        certificate'. This certificate will represent the holder's proportionate 
        ownership in the leased asset and he will assume the rights and obligations 
        of the owner/lessor to that extent. Since the asset is already leased 
        to the lessee, lease will continue with the new owners, each one of the 
        holders of this certificate will have the right to enjoy a part of the 
        rent according to his proportion of ownership in the asset. Similarly 
        he will also assume the obligations of the lessor to the extent of his 
        ownership. Therefore, in the case of total destruction of the asset, he 
        will suffer the loss to the extent of his ownership. These certificates, 
        being an evidence of proportionate ownership in a tangible asset, can 
        be negotiated and traded in freely in the market and can serve as an instrument 
        easily convertible into cash. Thus they may help in solving the problems 
        of liquidity management faced by the Islamic banks and financial institutions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It should be remembered, however, that the certificate must represent 
        ownership of an undivided part of the asset with all its rights and obligations. 
        Misunderstanding this basic concept, some quarters tried to issue Ijarah 
        certificates representing the holder's right to claim certain amount of 
        the rental only without assigning to him any kind of ownership in the 
        asset. It means that the holder of such a certificate has no relation 
        with the leased asset at all. His only right is to share the rentals received 
        from the lessee. This type of securitization is not allowed in Shari&#145;ah. 
        As explained earlier in this chapter, the rent after being due is a debt 
        payable by the lessee. The debt or any security representing debt only 
        is not a negotiable instrument in Shari&#145;ah, because trading in such 
        an instrument amounts to trade in money or in monetary obligation which 
        is not allowed, except on the basis of equality, and if the equality of 
        value is observed while trading in such instruments, the very purpose 
        of securitization is defeated. Therefore, this type of Ijarah certificates 
        cannot serve the purpose of creating a secondary market. It is, therefore, 
        necessary that the Ijarah certificates are designed to represent real 
        ownership of the leased assets, and not only a right to receive rent. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="Head"></a>Head-Lease </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        Another concept developed in the modern leasing business is that of 'head-leasing.' 
        In this arrangement a lessee sub-leases the property to a number of sub-lessees. 
        Then, he invites others to participate in his business by making them 
        share the rentals received by his sub-lessees. For making them participate 
        in receiving rentals, he charges a specified amount from them. This arrangement 
        is not in accordance with the principles of Shari&#145;ah. The reason 
        is obvious. The lessee does not own the property. He is entitled to benefit 
        from its usufruct only. That usufruct he has passed on to his sub-lessees 
        by contracting a sub-lease with them. Now he does not own anything, neither 
        the corpus of the property, nor its usufruct. What he has is the right 
        to receive rent only. Therefore, he assigns a part of this right to other 
        persons. It is already explained in detail that this right cannot be traded 
        in, because it amounts to selling a receivable debt at a discount which 
        is one of the forms of riba prohibited by the Holy Qur&#146;an and Sunnah. 
        Therefore, this concept is not acceptable. <br>
        These are some basic features of the 'financial lease' which are not in 
        conformity with the dictates of Shari&#145;ah. While using the lease as 
        an Islamic mode of finance, these shortcomings must be avoided. <br>
        <br>
        The list of the possible shortcomings in the lease agreement is not restricted 
        to what has been mentioned above, but only the basic errors found in different 
        agreements have been pointed out, and the basic principles of Islamic 
        leasing have been summarized. An Islamic lease agreement must conform 
        to all of them.<br>
