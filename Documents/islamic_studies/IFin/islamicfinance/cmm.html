          A contract of mudarabah normally presumes that the mudarib has not invested 
          anything to the mudarabah. He is responsible for the management only, 
          while all the investment comes from rabb-ul-mal. But there may be situations 
          where mudarib also wants to invest some of his money into the business 
          of mudarabah. In such cases, musharakah and mudarabah are combined together. 
          For example, A gave to B Rs. 100000/- in a contract of mudarabah. B 
          added Rs. 50000/- from his own pocket with the permission of A. This 
          type of partnership will be treated as a combination of musharakah and 
          mudarabah. Here the mudarib may allocate for himself a certain percentage 
          of profit on account of his investment as a sharik, and at the same 
          time he may allocate another percentage for his management and work 
          as a mudarib. The normal basis for allocation of the profit in the above 
          example would be that B shall secure one third of the actual profit 
          on account of his investment, and the remaining two thirds of the profit 
          shall be distributed between them equally. However, the parties may 
          agree on any other proportion. The only condition is that the sleeping 
          partner should not get more percentage than the proportion of his investment. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, in the aforesaid example, A cannot allocate for himself more 
          than two thirds of the total profit, because he has not invested more 
          than two thirds of the total capital. Short of that, they can agree 
          on any proportion. If they have agreed on that the total profit will 
          be distributed equally, it means that one third of the profit shall 
          go to B as an investor, while one fourth of the remaining two thirds 
          will go to him as a mudarib. The rest will be given to A as &quot;rabb-ul-mal.&quot;<br>

          <b><a name="musharakah"></a>Musharakah &amp; Mudarabah as Modes of Financing 
          </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          In the foregoing sections, the traditional concept of musharakah and 
          mudarabah and the basic principles of Shari&#145;ah governing them have 
          been explained. It is pertinent now to discuss the way these instruments 
          may be used for the purpose of financing in the context of modern trade 
          and industry. <br>
          <br>
          The concept of musharakah and mudarabah envisaged in the books of Islamic 
          Fiqh generally presumes that these contracts are meant for initiating 
          a joint venture whereby all the partners participate in the business 
          right from its inception and continue to be partners upto the end of 
          the business when all the assets are liquidated. One can hardly find 
          in the traditional books of Islamic Fiqh the concept of a running business 
          where partners join and leave the enterprise without affecting in any 
          way the continuity of the business. Obviously, the classical books of 
          Islamic Fiqh were written in an environment where the large scale commercial 
          enterprises were not in vogue and the commercial activities were not 
          so complex as they are today. Therefore, they did not generally dwell 
          upon the question of such a running business. <br>
          <br>
          However, it does not mean that the concept of musharakah and mudarabah 
          cannot be used for financing a running business. The concept of musharakah 
          and mudarabah is based on some basic principles. As long as these principles 
          are fully complied with, the details of their application may vary from 
          time to time. Let us have a look at these basic principles before entering 
          the details: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(1)</b> Financing through musharakah and mudarabah does never mean 
          the advancing of money. It means to participation in the business and 
          in the case of musharakah, sharing in the assets of the business to 
          the extent of the ratio of financing. <br>
          <b><br>
          (2)</b> An investor / financier must share the loss incurred by the 
          business to the extent of his financing. <br>
          <br>
          <b> (3)</b> The partners are at liberty to determine, with mutual consent, 
          the ratio of profit allocated to each one of them, which may differ 
          from the ratio of investment. However, the partner who has expressly 
          excluded himself from the responsibility of work for the business cannot 
          claim more than the ratio of his investment. <br>
          <br>
          <b>(4)</b> The loss suffered by each partner must be exactly in the 
          proportion of his investment. <br>
          Keeping these broad principles in view, we proceed to see how musharakah 
          and mudarabah can be used in different sectors of financing: <br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="project"></a>Project Financing </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          In the case of project financing, the traditional method of musharakah 
          or mudarabah can be easily adopted. If the financier wants to finance 
          the whole project, the form of mudarabah can come into operation. If 
          investment comes from both sides, the form of musharakah can be adopted. 
          In this case, if the management is the sole responsibility of one party, 
          while the investment comes from both, a combination of musharakah and 
          mudarabah can be brought into play according to the rules already discussed. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Since musharakah or mudarabah would have been effected from the very 
          inception of the project, no problem with regard to the valuation of 
          capital should arise. Similarly, the distribution of profits according 
          to the normal accounting standards should not be difficult. However, 
          if the financier wants to withdraw from the musharakah, while the other 
          party wants to continue the business, the latter can purchase the share 
          of the former at an agreed price. In this way the financier may get 
          back the amount he has invested alongwith a profit, if the business 
          has earned a profit. The basis for determining the price of his share 
          shall be discussed in detail later on (while discussing the financing 
          of working capital). <br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, the businessman can continue with his project, either 
          on his own or by selling the first financier's share to some other person 
          who can substitute the financier. <br>
          Since financial institutions do not normally want to remain partner 
          of a specific project for good, they can sell their share to other partners 
          of the project as aforesaid. If the sale of the share on one time basis 
          is not feasible for the lack of liquidity in the project, the share 
          of the financier can be divided into smaller units and each unit can 
          be sold after a suitable interval. Whenever a unit is sold, the share 
          of the financier in the project is reduced to that extent, and when 
          all the units are sold, the financier comes out of the project totally. 
          <b><br>
          <br>
          Securitization of musharakah</b> <a name="securitization"></a> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          Musharakah is a mode of financing which can be securitized easily, especially, 
          in the case of big projects where huge amounts are required which a 
          limited number of people cannot afford to subscribe. Every subscriber 
          can be given a musharakah certificate which represents his proportionate 
          ownership in the assets of the musharakah, and after the project is 
          started by acquiring substantial non-liquid assets, these musharakah 
          certificates can be treated as negotiable instruments and can be bought 
          and sold in the secondary market. However, trading in these certificates 
          is not allowed when all the assets of the musharakah are still in liquid 
          form (i.e., in the shape of cash or receivables or advances due from 
          others). <br>
          <br>
          For proper understanding of this point, it must be noted that subscribing 
          to a musharakah is different from advancing a loan. A bond issued to 
          evidence a loan has nothing to do with the actual business undertaken 
          with the borrowed money. The bond stands for a loan repayable to the 
          holder in any case, and mostly with interest. The musharakah certificate, 
          on the contrary, represents the direct pro rata ownership of the holder 
          in the assets of the project. If all the assets of the joint project 
          are in liquid form, the certificate will represent a certain proportion 
          of money owned by the project. For example, one hundred certificates, 
          having a value of Rs. one million each, have been issued. It means that 
          the total worth of the project is Rs. 100 million. If nothing has been 
          purchased by this money, every certificate will represent Rs. one million. 
          In this case, this certificate cannot be sold in the market except at 
          par value, because if one certificate is sold for more than Rs. one 
          million, it will mean that Rs. one million are being sold in exchange 
          for more than Rs. one million, which is not allowed in Shari&#145;ah, 
          because where money is exchanged for money, both must be equal. Any 
          excess at either side is riba. <br>
          <br>
          However, when the subscribed money is employed in purchasing non-liquid 
          assets like land, building, machinery, raw material, furniture etc. 
          the musharakah certificates will represent the holders' proportionate 
          ownership in these assets. Thus, in the above example, one certificate 
          will stand for one hundredth share in these assets. In this case it 
          will be allowed by the Shari&#145;ah to sell these certificates in the 
          secondary market for any price agreed upon between the parties which 
          may be more than the face value of the certificate, because the subject 
          matter of the sale is a share in the tangible assets and not in money 
          only, therefore the certificates may be taken as any other commodities 
          which may be sold with profit or at a loss. <br>
          <br>
          In most cases, the assets of the project are a mixture of liquid and 
          non-liquid assets. This comes to happen when the working partner has 
          converted a part of the subscribed money into fixed assets or raw material, 
          while rest of money is still liquid. Or, the project, after converting 
          all its money into non-liquid assets may have sold some of them and 
          has acquired their sale proceeds in the form of money. In some cases 
          the price of its sales may have become due on its customers but may 
          have not yet been received. These receivable amounts, being a debt, 
          are also treated as liquid money. The question arises about the rule 
          of Shari&#145;ah in a situation where the assets of the project are 
          a mixture of liquid and non-liquid assets, whether the musharakah certificates 
          of such a project can be traded in? The opinions of the contemporary 
          Muslim jurists are different on this point. According to the traditional 
          Shafi&#145;i school, this type of certificate cannot be sold. Their 
          classic view is that whenever there is a combination of liquid and non-liquid 
          assets, it cannot be sold unless the non-liquid part of the business 
          is separated and is sold independently. <br>
          <br>
          The Hanafi school, however, is of the opinion that whenever there is 
          a combination of liquid and non-liquid assets, it can be sold and purchased 
          for an amount greater than the amount of liquid assets in the combination, 
          in which case money will be taken as sold at an equal amount and the 
          excess will be taken as the price of the non-liquid assets owned by 
          the business. <br>
          <br>
          Suppose, the Musharakah project contains 40% non-liquid assets i.e. 
          machinery, fixtures etc. and 60% liquid assets, i.e. cash and receivables. 
          Now, each musharakah certificate having the face value of Rs. 100/- 
          represents Rs. 60/- worth of liquid assets, and Rs. 40/- worth of non-liquid 
          assets. This certificate may be sold at any price more than Rs. 60. 
          If it is sold at Rs. 110/- it will mean that Rs. 60 of the price are 
          against Rs. 60/- contained in the certificate and Rs. 50/- is against 
          the proportionate share in the non-liquid assets. But it will never 
          be allowed to sell the certificate for a price of Rs. 60/- or less, 
          because in the case of Rs. 60/- it will not set off the amount of Rs. 
          60, let alone the other assets. <br>
          <br>
          According to the Hanafi view, no specific proportion of non-liquid assets 
          in the whole is prescribed. Therefore, even if the non-liquid assets 
          represent less than 50% in the whole, its trading according to the above 
          formula is allowed. <br>
          <br>
          However, most of the contemporary scholars, including those of Shafi&#145;i 
          school, have allowed trading in the units of the whole only if the non-liquid 
          assets of the business are more than 50%. Therefore, for a valid trading 
          of the musharakah certificates acceptable to all schools, it is necessary 
          that the portfolio of musharakah consists of non-liquid assets valuing 
          more than 50% of its total worth. However, if Hanafi view is adopted, 
          trading will be allowed even if the non-liquid assets are less than 
          50%, but the size of the non-liquid assets should not be negligible.<br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="Financing"></a>Financing of a single transaction </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          ) <br>
          Musharakah and mudarabah can be used more easily for financing a single 
          transaction. Apart from fulfilling the day to-day needs of small traders, 
          these instruments can be employed for financing imports and exports. 
          An importer can approach a financier to finance him for that single 
          transaction of import alone on the basis of musharakah or mudarabah. 
          The banks can also use these instruments for import financing. If the 
          letter of credit has been opened without any margin, the form of mudarabah 
          can be adopted, and if the L/C is opened with some margin, the form 
          of musharakah or a combination of both will be relevant. After the imported 
          goods are cleared from the port, their sale proceeds may be shared by 
          the importer and the financier according to a pre-agreed ratio. <br>
          <br>
          In this case, the ownership of the imported goods shall remain with 
          the financier to the extent of the ratio of his investment. This musharakah 
          can be restricted to an agreed term, and if the imported goods are not 
          sold in the market up to the expiry of the term, the importer may himself 
          purchase the share of the financier, making himself the sole owner of 
          the goods. However, the sale in this case should take place at the market 
          rate or at a price agreed between the parties on the date of sale, and 
          not at pre-greed price at the time of entering into musharakah. If the 
          price is pre-agreed, the financier cannot compel the client / importer 
          to purchase it. <br>
          <br>
          Similarly, musharakah will be even easier in the case of export financing. 
          The exporter has a specific order from abroad. The price on which the 
          goods will be exported is well-known before hand, and the financier 
          can easily calculate the expected profit. He may finance him on the 
          basis of musharakah or mudarabah, and may share the amount of export 
          bill on a pre-agreed percentage. In order to secure himself from any 
          negligence on the part of the exporter, the financier may put a condition 
          that it will be the responsibility of the exporter to export the goods 
          in full conformity with the conditions of the L/C. In this case, if 
          some discrepancies are found, the exporter alone shall be responsible, 
          and the financier shall be immune from any loss due to such discrepancies, 
          because it is caused by the negligence of the exporter. However, being 
          a partner of the exporter, the financier will be liable to bear any 
          loss which may be caused due to any reason other than the negligence 
          or misconduct of the exporter. <br>
          <b><br>
          <a name="Finanwork"></a>Financing of the working capital </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          Where finances are required for the working capital of a running business, 
          the instrument of musharakah may be used in the following manner: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(1)</b> The capital of the running business may be evaluated with 
          mutual consent. It is already mentioned while discussing the traditional 
          concept of musharakah that it is not necessary, according to Imam Malik, 
          that the capital of musharakah is contributed in cash form. Non-liquid 
          assets can also form part of the capital on the basis of evaluation. 
          This view can be adopted here. In this way, the value of the business 
          can be treated as the investment of the person who seeks finance, while 
          the amount given by the financier can be treated as his share of investment. 
          The musharakah may be effected for a particular period, like one year 
          or six months or less. Both the parties agree on a certain percentage 
          of the profit to be given to the financier, which should not exceed 
          the percentage of his investment, because he shall not work for the 
          business. On the expiry of the term, all liquid and non-liquid assets 
          of the business are again evaluated, and the profit may be distributed 
          on the basis of this evaluation. <br>
          <br>
          Although, according to the traditional concept, the profit cannot be 
          determined unless all the assets of the business are liquidated, yet 
          the valuation of the assets can be treated as &quot;constructive liquidation&quot; 
          with mutual consent of the parties, because there is no specific prohibition 
          in Shari&#145;ah against it. It can also mean that the working partner 
          has purchased the share of the financier in the assets of the business, 
          and the price of his share has been determined on the basis of valuation, 
          keeping in view the ratio of profit allocated for him according to the 
          terms of musharakah. <br>
          <br>
          For example, the total value of the business of A is 30 units. B finances 
          another 20 units, raising the total worth to 50 units; 40% having been 
          contributed by B, and 60% by A. It is agreed that B shall get 20% of 
          the actual profit. At the end of the term, the total worth of the business 
          has increased to 100 units. Now, if the share of B is purchased by A, 
          he should have paid to him 40 units, because he owns 40% of the assets 
          of the business. But in order to reflect the agreed ratio of profit 
          in the price of his share, the formula of pricing will be different. 
          Any increase in the value of the business shall be divided between the 
          parties in the ratio of 20% and 80%, because this ratio was determined 
          in the contract for the purpose of distribution of profit. <br>
          <br>
          Since the increase in the value of the business is 50 units, these 50 
          units are divided at the ratio of 20-80, meaning thereby that 10 units 
          will have been earned by B. These 10 units will be added to his original 
          20 units, and the price of his share will be 30 units. <br>
          In the case of loss, however, any decrease in the total value of the 
          assets should be divided between them exactly in the ratio of their 
          investment, i.e., in the ratio of 40/60. Therefore, if the value of 
          the business has decreased, in the above example, by 10 units reducing 
          the total number of units to 40, the loss of 4 units shall be borne 
          by B (being 40% of the loss). These 4 units shall be deducted from his 
          original 20 units, and the price of his share shall be determined as 
          16 units. <br>

          ) <br>
          2. Financing on the basis of musharakah according to the above procedure 
          may be difficult in a business having a large number of fixed assets, 
          particularly in a running industry, because the valuation of all its 
          assets and their depreciation or appreciation may create accounting 
          problems giving rise to disputes. In such cases, musharakah may be applied 
          in another way. <br>
          <br>
          The major difficulties in these cases arise in the calculation of indirect 
          expenses, like depreciation of the machinery, salaries of the staff 
          etc. In order to solve this problem, the parties may agree on the principle 
          that, instead of net profit, the gross profit will be distributed between 
          the parties, that is, the indirect expenses shall not be deducted from 
          the distribute able profit. It will mean that all the indirect expenses 
          shall be borne by the industrialist voluntarily, and only direct expenses 
          (like those of raw material, direct labor, electricity etc.) shall be 
          borne by the musharakah. But since the industrialist is offering his 
          machinery, building and staff to the musharakah voluntarily, the percentage 
          of his profit may be increased to compensate him to some extent. <br>
          <br>
          This arrangement may be justified on the ground that the clients of 
          financial institutions do not restrict themselves to the operations 
          for which they seek finance from the financial institutions. Their machinery 
          and staff etc. is, therefore, engaged in some other business also which 
          may not be subject to musharakah, and in such a case the whole cost 
          of these expenses cannot be imposed on the musharakah. <br>
          <br>
          Let us take a practical example. Suppose a ginning factory has a building 
          worth Rs. 22 million, plant and machinery valuing Rs. 2 million and 
          the staff is paid Rs. 50,000/- per month. The factory sought finance 
          of Rs. 5,000,000/- from a bank on the basis of musharakah for a term 
          of one year. It means that after one year the musharakah will be terminated, 
          and the profits accrued up to that point will be distributed between 
          the parties according to the agreed ratio. While determining the profit, 
          all direct expenses will be deducted from the income. The direct expenses 
          may include the following: <br>
          <br>
          <b>1.</b> the amount spent in purchasing raw material <br>
          <br>
          <b>2.</b> the wages of the labor directly involved in processing the 
          raw material <br>
          <br>
          <b>3.</b> the expenses for electricity consumed in the process of ginning 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>4.</b> the bills for other services directly rendered for the musharakah 
          <br>
          <br>
          So far as the building, the machinery and the salary of other staff 
          is concerned, it is obvious that they are not meant for the business 
          of the musharakah alone, because the musharakah will terminate within 
          one year, while the building and the machinery are purchased for a much 
          longer term in which the ginning factory will use them for its own business 
          which is not subject to this one-year musharakah. Therefore, the whole 
          cost of the building and the machinery cannot be borne by this short-term 
          musharakah. What can be done at the most is that the depreciation caused 
          to the building and the machinery during the term of the musharakah 
          is included in its expenses. But in practical terms, it will be very 
          difficult to determine the cost of depreciation, and it may cause disputes 
          also. Therefore, there are two practical ways to solve this problem. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In the first instance, the parties may agree that the musharakah portfolio 
          will pay an agreed rent to the client for the use of the machinery and 
          the building owned by him. This rent will be paid to him from the musharakah 
          fund irrespective of profit or loss accruing to the business. <br>
          The second option is that, instead of paying rent to the client, the 
          ratio of his profit is increased. <br>
          From the point of view of Shari&#145;ah, it may be justified on the 
          analogy of mudarabah in services which is allowed in the view of Imam 
          Ahmad bin Hanbal&nbsp;<img src="Rahmat-ul-Allah.gif" width="124" height="38"><br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="running"></a>Running Musharakah Account On the Basis of 
          Daily Products </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          <b>3.</b> Many financial institutions finance the working capital of 
          an enterprise by opening a running account for them from where the clients 
          draw different amounts at different intervals, but at the same time, 
          they keep returning their surplus amounts. Thus the process of debit 
          and credit goes on up to the date of maturity, and the interest is calculated 
          on the basis of daily products. <br>
          Can such an arrangement be possible under the musharakah or mudarabah 
          modes of financing? Obviously, being a new phenomenon, no express answer 
          to this question can be found in the classical works of Islamic Fiqh. 
          However, keeping in view the basic principles of musharakah the following 
          procedure may be suggested for this purpose: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(i)</b> A certain percentage of the actual profit must be allocated 
          for the management. <br>
          <b><br>
          (ii)</b> The remaining percentage of the profit must be allocated for 
          the investors. <br>
          <b><br>
          (iii)</b> The loss, if any, should be borne by the investors only in 
          exact proportion of their respective investments. <br>
          <br>
          <b> (iv)</b> The average balance of the contributions made to the musharakah 
          account calculated on the basis of daily products shall be treated as 
          the share capital of the financier. <br>
          <b><br>
          (v)</b> The profit accruing at the end of the term shall be calculated 
          on daily product basis, and shall be distributed accordingly. <br>
          <br>
          If such an arrangement is agreed upon between the parties, it does not 
          seem to violate any basic principle of the musharakah. However, this 
          suggestion needs further consideration and research by the experts of 
          Islamic jurisprudence. Practically, it means that the parties have agreed 
          to the principle that the profit accrued to the musharakah portfolio 
          at the end of the term will be divided on the capital utilized per day, 
          which will lead to the average of the profit earned by each rupee per 
          day. The amount of this average profit per rupee per day will be multiplied 
          by the number of the days each investor has put his money into the business, 
          which will determine his profit entitlement on daily product basis. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Some contemporary scholars do not allow this method of calculating profits 
          on the ground that it is just a conjectural method which does not reflect 
          the actual profits really earned by a partner of the musharakah, because 
          the business may have earned huge profits during a period when a particular 
          investor had no money invested in the business at all, or had a very 
          negligible amount invested, still, he will be treated at par with other 
          investors who had huge amounts invested in the business during that 
          period. Conversely, the business may have suffered a great loss during 
          a period when a particular investor had huge amounts invested in it. 
          Still, he will pass on some of his loss to other investors who had no 
          investment in that period or their size of investment was negligible. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This argument can be refuted on the ground that it is not necessary 
          in a musharakah that a partner should earn profit on his own money only. 
          Once a musharakah pool comes into existence, the profits accruing to 
          the joint pool are earned by all the participants, regardless of whether 
          their money is or is not utilized in a particular transaction. This 
          is particularly true of the Hanafi School which does not deem it necessary 
          for a valid musharakah that the monetary contributions of the partners 
          are mixed up together. It means that if A has entered into a musharakah 
          contract with B, but has not yet disbursed his money into the joint 
          pool, he will still be entitled to a share in the profit of the transactions 
          effected by B for the musharakah through his own money. Although his 
          entitlement to a share in the profit will be subject to the disbursement 
          of money undertaken by him, yet the fact remains that the profit of 
          this particular transaction did not accrue to his money, because the 
          money disbursed by him at a later stage may be used for another transaction. 
          Suppose, A and B entered into a musharakah to conduct a business of 
          Rs. 100,000/- <br>
          <br>
          They agreed that each one of them shall contribute Rs. 50,000/- and 
          the profits will be distributed by them equally. A did not yet invest 
          his Rs. 50,000/- into the joint pool. B found a profitable deal and 
          purchased two air-conditions for the musharakah for Rs. 50,000/- contributed 
          by himself and sold them for Rs. 60,000/-, thus earning a profit of 
          Rs. 10000/-. A contributed his share of Rs. 50,000/- after this deal. 
          The partners purchased two refrigerators through this contribution which 
          could not be sold at a greater price than Rs. 48000/- meaning thereby 
          that this deal resulted in a loss of Rs. 2000/- Although the transaction 
          effected by A's money brought loss of Rs. 2000/- while the profitable 
          deal of air-conditions was financed entirely by B's money in which A 
          had no contribution, yet A will be entitled to a share in the profit 
          of the first deal. The loss of Rs. 2000/- in the second deal will be 
          set off from the profit of the first deal reducing the aggregate profit 
          to Rs. 8000/-. This profit of Rs. 8000/- will be shared by both partners 
          equally. It means that A will get Rs. 4000/-, even though the transaction 
          effected by his money has suffered loss. <br>
          <br>
          The reason is that once a musharakah contract is entered into by the 
          parties, all the subsequent transactions effected for musharakah belong 
          to the joint pool, regardless of whose individual money is utilized 
          in them. Each partner is a party to each transaction by virtue of his 
          entering into the contract of musharakah. <br>
          <br>
          A possible objection to the above explanation may be that in the above 
          example, A had undertaken to pay Rs. 50,000/- and it was known before 
          hand that he will contribute a specified amount to the musharakah. But 
          in the proposed running account of musharakah where the partners are 
          coming in and going out every day, nobody has undertaken to contribute 
          any specific amount. Therefore, the capital contributed by each partner 
          is unknown at the time of entering into musharakah, which should render 
          the musharakah invalid. <br>
          <br>
          The answer to the above objection is that the classical scholars of 
          Islamic Fiqh have different views about whether it is necessary for 
          a valid musharakah that the capital is pre-known to the partners. The 
          Hanafi scholars are unanimous on the point that it is not a pre-condition. 
          Al-Kasani, the famous Hanafi jurist, writes: <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="arabic_modesof_Financing_cmm.gif" width="414" height="238"> 
          <br>
          <br>
          According to our Hanafi School, it is not a condition for the validity 
          of musharakah that the amount of capital is known, while it is a condition 
          according to Imam Shafi&#145;i. Our argument is that Jahalah (uncertainty) 
          in itself does not render a contract invalid, unless it leads to disputes. 
          And the uncertainty in the capital at the time of musharakah does not 
          lead to disputes, because it is generally known when the commodities 
          are purchased for the musharakah, therefore it does not lead to uncertainty 
          in the profit at the time of distribution.&quot; (Badai&#145;-us-sanai&#145; 
          v.6 p.63) <br>
          <br>
          It is, therefore, clear from the above that even if the amount of the 
          capital is not known at the time of musharakah, the contract is valid. 
          The only condition is that it should not lead to the uncertainty in 
          the profit at the time of distribution.<br>
          <b><br>
          <a name="distributin"><br>
          </a>Distribution of profit on daily product basis fulfills this condition. 
          </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          It is true that the concept of a running musharakah where the partners 
          at times draw some amounts and at other times inject new money and the 
          profits are calculated on daily products basis is not found in the classical 
          books of Islamic Fiqh. But merely this fact cannot render a new arrangement 
          invalid in Shari&#145;ah, so far as it does not violate any basic principle 
          of musharakah. In the proposed system, all the partners are treated 
          at par. The profit of each partner is calculated on the basis of the 
          period for which his money remained in the joint pool. There is no doubt 
          in the fact that the aggregate profits accrued to the pool are generated 
          by the joint utilization of different amounts contributed by the participants 
          at different times. Therefore, if all of them agree with mutual consent 
          to distribute the profits on daily products basis, there is no injunction 
          of Shari&#145;ah which makes it impermissible; rather, it is covered 
          under the general guideline given by the Holy Prophet<img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36"> 
          in his famous hadith quoted in this book more than once: <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="arabic_modeofFinance_cmm.gif" width="448" height="44"> 
          <br>
          <b>Muslims are bound by their mutual agreements unless they hold a permissible 
          thing as prohibited or a prohibited thing as permissible. <br>
          </b><br>
          <b>2</b>. If distribution on daily products basis is not accepted, it 
          will mean that no partner can draw any amount from, nor can he inject 
          new amounts to the joint pool. Similarly, nobody will be able to subscribe 
          to the joint pool except at the particular dates of the commencement 
          of a new term. This arrangement is totally impracticable on the deposits 
          side of the banks and financial institutions where the accounts are 
          debited and credited by the depositors many times a day. The rejection 
          of the concept of the daily products will compel them to wait for months 
          before they deposit their surplus money in a profitable account. This 
          will hinder the utilization of savings for development of industry and 
          trade, and will keep the wheel of financial activities jammed for long 
          periods. There is no other solution for this problem except to apply 
          the method of daily products for the calculation of profits, and since 
          there is no specific injunction of Shari&#145;ah against it, there is 
          no reason why this method should not be adopted<br>
