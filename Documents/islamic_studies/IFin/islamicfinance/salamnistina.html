      <p align="justify"><b><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</b><br>
        It is one of the basic conditions for the validity of a sale in Shariah 
        that the commodity (intended to be sold) must be in the physical or constructive 
        possession of the seller. This condition has three ingredients: <br>
        <br>
        <b> Firstly</b>, the commodity must be existing; therefore, a commodity 
        which does not exist at the time of sale cannot be sold. <br>
        <b><br>
        Secondly</b>, the seller should have acquired the ownership of that commodity. 
        Therefore, if the commodity is existing, but the seller does not own it, 
        he cannot sell it to anybody. <br>
        <b><br>
        Thirdly</b>, mere ownership is not enough. It should have come in to the 
        possession of the seller, either physically or constructively. If the 
        seller owns a commodity, but he has not taken its delivery himself or 
        through an agent, he cannot sell it. <br>
        There are only two exceptions to this general principle in Shari&#145;ah. 
        One is Salam and the other is Istisna&#145;. Both are sales of a special 
        nature, and in the present chapter the concept of these two kinds of sale 
        and the extent to which they can be used for the purpose of financing 
        will be explained. <br>
        <b> <br>
        <a name="meaning"></a> Meaning of Salam </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        Salam is a sale whereby the seller undertakes to supply some specific 
        goods to the buyer at a future date in exchange of an advanced price fully 
        paid at spot. <br>
        Here the price is cash, but the supply of the purchased goods is deferred. 
        The buyer is called &quot;rabb-us-salam&quot;, the seller is &quot;muslam 
        ilaih&quot;, the cash price is &quot;ra&#146;s-ul-mal&quot; and the purchased 
        commodity is termed as &quot;muslam fih&quot;, but for the purpose of 
        simplicity, I shall use the English synonyms of these terms. <br>
        Salam was allowed by the Holy Prophet &#146;<img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">subject 
        to certain conditions. The basic purpose of this sale was to meet the 
        needs of the small farmers who needed money to grow their crops and to 
        feed their family upto the time of harvest. After the prohibition of riba 
        they could not take usurious loans. Therefore, it was allowed for them 
        to sell the agricultural products in advance. <br>
        Similarly, the traders of Arabia used to export goods to other places 
        and to import some other goods to their homeland. They needed money to 
        undertake this type of business. They could not borrow from the usurers 
        after the prohibition of riba. It was, therefore, allowed for them that 
        they sell the goods in advance. After receiving their cash price, they 
        could easily undertake the aforesaid business. <br>
        <br>
        Salam was beneficial to the seller, because he received the price in advance, 
        and it was beneficial to the buyer also, because normally, the price in 
        salam used to be lower than the price in spot sales. The permissibility 
        of salam was an exception to the general rule that prohibits the forward 
        sales, and therefore, it was subjected to some strict conditions. These 
        conditions are summarized below: <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="conditions"></a>Conditions of Salam </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        <b>1.</b> First of all, it is necessary for the validity of Salam that 
        the buyer pays the price in full to the seller at the time of effecting 
        the sale. It is necessary because in the absence of full payment by the 
        buyer, it will be tantamount to sale of a debt against a debt, which is 
        expressly prohibited by the Holy Prophet <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">Moreover, 
        the basic wisdom behind the permissibility of salam is to fulfill the 
        instant needs of the seller. If the price is not paid to him in full, 
        the basic purpose of the transaction will be defeated. Therefore, all 
        the Muslim jurists are unanimous on the point that full payment of the 
        price is necessary in Salam. However, Imam Malik is of the view that the 
        seller may give a concession of two or three days to the buyers, but this 
        concession should not form part of the agreement. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 2.</b> Salam can be effected in those commodities only the quality 
        and quantity of which can be specified exactly. The things whose quality 
        or quantity is not determined by specification cannot be sold through 
        the contract of salam. For example, precious stones cannot be sold on 
        the basis of salam, because every piece of precious stones is normally 
        different from the other either in its quality or in its size or weight 
        and their exact specification is not generally possible. <br>
        <b><br>
        3.</b> Salam cannot be effected on a particular commodity or on a product 
        of a particular field or farm. For example, if the seller undertakes to 
        supply the wheat of a particular field, or the fruit of a particular tree, 
        the salam will not be valid, because there is a possibility that the crop 
        of that particular field or the fruit of that tree is destroyed before 
        delivery, and, given such possibility, the delivery remains uncertain. 
        The same rule is applicable to every commodity the supply of which is 
        not certain. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 4.</b> It is necessary that the quality of the commodity (intended 
        to be purchased through salam) is fully specified leaving no ambiguity 
        which may lead to a dispute. All the possible details in this respect 
        must be expressly mentioned. <br>
        <b><br>
        5.</b> It is also necessary that the quantity of the commodity is agreed 
        upon in unequivocal terms. If the commodity is quantified in weights according 
        to the usage of its traders, its weight must be determined, and if it 
        is quantified through measures, its exact measure should be known. What 
        is normally weighed cannot be quantified in measures and vice versa. <br>
        <b><br>
        6.</b> The exact date and place of delivery must be specified in the contract. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        7.</b> Salam cannot be effected in respect of things which must be delivered 
        at spot. For example, if gold is purchased in exchange of silver, it is 
        necessary, according to Shari&#145;ah, that the delivery of both be simultaneous. 
        Here, salam cannot work. Similarly, if wheat is bartered for barley, the 
        simultaneous delivery of both is necessary for the validity of sale. Therefore 
        the contract of salam in this case is not allowed. All the Muslim jurists 
        are unanimous on the principle that salam will not be valid unless all 
        these conditions are fully observed, because they are based on the express 
        ahadith of the Holy Prophet<img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36"> 
        The most famous hadith in this context is the one in which the Holy Prophet 
        <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">has said: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="arabic_conditionofsalam_islamnistisna.gif" width="432" height="51"><br>
        &quot;Whoever wishes to enter into a contract of salam, he must effect 
        the Salam according to the specified measure and the specified weight 
        and the specified date of delivery&quot;. <br>
        However, there are certain other conditions which have been a point of 
        difference between the different schools of the Islamic jurisprudence. 
        Some of these conditions are discussed below: <br>
        <b><br>
        (1)</b> It is necessary, according to the Hanafi school, that the commodity 
        (for which salam is effected) remains available in the market right from 
        the day of contract upto the date of delivery. Therefore, if a commodity 
        is not available in the market at the time of the contract, salam cannot 
        be effected in respect of that commodity, even though it is expected that 
        it will be available in the markets at the date of delivery. <br>
        <br>
        However, the other three schools of Fiqh (i.e. Shafi&#145;i, Maliki, and 
        Hanbali) are of the view that the availability of the commodity at the 
        time of the contract is not a condition for the validity of salam. What 
        is necessary, according to them, is that it should be available at the 
        time of delivery. This view can be adopted in the present circumstances. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        (2)</b> It is necessary, according to the Hanafi and Hanbali schools that 
        the time of delivery is, at least, one month from the date of agreement. 
        If the time of delivery is fixed earlier than one month, salam is not 
        valid. Their argument is that salam has been allowed for the needs of 
        small farmers and traders and therefore, they should be given enough opportunity 
        to acquire the commodity. They may not be able to supply the commodity 
        before one month. Moreover, the price in salam is normally lower than 
        the price in spot sales. This concession in the price may be justified 
        only when the commodities are delivered after a period which has a reasonable 
        bearing on the prices. A period of less than one month does not normally 
        affect the prices. Therefore, the minimum time of delivery should not 
        be less than one month. Imam Malik supports the view that there should 
        be a minimum period for the contract of salam. However, he is of the opinion 
        that it should not be less than fifteen days, because the rates of the 
        market may change within a fortnight. This view is, however, opposed by 
        some other jurists, like Imam Shafi&#145;i and some Hanafi jurists also. 
        They say that the Holy Prophet <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">has 
        not specified a minimum period for the validity of salam. The only condition, 
        according to the Hadith, is that the time of delivery must be clearly 
        defined. Therefore, no minimum period can be prescribed. The parties may 
        fix any date for delivery with mutual consent. This view seems to be preferable 
        in the present circumstances, because the Holy Prophet <img src="Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">has 
        not prescribed a minimum period. The jurists have prescribed different 
        periods which range between one day to one month. It is obvious that they 
        have done so on the basis of expedience and keeping in view the interest 
        of the poor sellers. But the expediency may differ from time to time and 
        from place to place. Likewise, sometimes it is more in the interest of 
        the seller to fix an earlier date. As far as the price is concerned, it 
        is not a necessary ingredient of salam that the price is always lower 
        than the market price on that day. The seller himself is the best judge 
        of his interest, and if he accepts an earlier date of delivery with his 
        free will and consent, there is no reason why he should be forbidden from 
        doing so. Certain contemporary jurists have adopted this view being more 
        suitable for the modern transactions. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="mode"></a>Salam as a mode of Financing </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        It is evident from the foregoing discussion that salam was allowed by 
        Shari&#145;ah to fulfill the needs of farmers and traders. Therefore, 
        it is basically a mode of financing for small farmers and traders. This 
        mode of financing can be used by the modern banks and financial institutions, 
        especially to finance the agricultural sector. As pointed out earlier, 
        the price in salam may be fixed at a lower rate than the price of those 
        commodities delivered at spot. In this way, the difference between the 
        two prices may be a valid profit for the banks or financial institutions. 
        In order to ensure that the seller shall deliver the commodity on the 
        agreed date, they can also ask him to furnish a security, which may be 
        in the form of a guarantee or in the form of mortgage or hypothecation. 
        In the case of default in delivery, the guarantor may be asked to deliver 
        the same commodity, and if there is a mortgage, the buyer / the financier 
        can sell the mortgaged property and the sale proceeds can be used either 
        to realize the required commodity by purchasing it from the market, or 
        to recover the price advanced by him. <br>
        <br>
        The only problem in salam which may agitate the modern banks and financial 
        institutions is that they will receive certain commodities from their 
        clients, and will not receive money. Being conversant with dealing in 
        money only, it seems to be cumbersome for them to receive different commodities 
        from different clients and to sell them in the market. They cannot sell 
        those commodities before they are actually delivered to them, because 
        it is prohibited in Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        But whenever we talk about the Islamic modes of financing, one basic point 
        should never be ignored. The point is that the concept of the financial 
        institutions dealing in money only is foreign to Islamic Shari&#145;ah. 
        If these institutions want to earn a halal profit, they shall have to 
        deal in commodities in one way or the other, because no profit is allowed 
        in Shari&#145;ah on advancing loans only. Therefore, the establishment 
        of an Islamic economy requires a basic change in the approach and in the 
        outlook of the financial institutions. They shall have to establish a 
        special cell for dealing in commodities. If such a special cell is established, 
        it should not be difficult to purchase commodities through salam and to 
        sell them in the spot markets. <br>
        <br>
        However, there are two other ways of benefiting from the contract of Salam. 
        <br>
        <b> <br>
        Firstly,</b> after purchasing a commodity by way of salam, the financial 
        institutions may sell it through a parallel contract of salam for the 
        same date of delivery. The period of salam in the second (parallel) transaction 
        being shorter, the price may be a little higher than the price of the 
        first transaction, and the difference between the two prices shall be 
        the profit earned by the institution. The shorter the period of salam, 
        the higher the price, and the greater the profit. In this way the institutions 
        may manage their short term financing portfolios. <br>
        <b><br>
        Secondly,</b> if a parallel contract of salam is not feasible for one 
        reason or another, they can obtain a promise to purchase from a third 
        party. This promise shoud be unilateral from the expected buyer. Being 
        merely a promise, and not the actual sale, their buyers will not have 
        to pay the price in advance. Therefore, a higher price may be fixed and 
        as soon as the commodity is received by the institution, it will be sold 
        to the third party at a pre-agreed price, according to the terms of the 
        promise. <br>
        <br>
        A third option is sometimes proposed that, at the date of delivery, the 
        commodity is sold back to the seller at a higher price. But this suggestion 
        is not in line with the dictates of Shari&#145;ah. It is never permitted 
        by the Shari&#145;ah that the purchased commodity is sold back to the 
        seller before the buyer takes its delivery, and if it is done at a higher 
        price it will be tantamount to riba which is totally prohibited. Even 
        if it is sold back to the seller after taking delivery from him, it cannot 
        be pre-arranged at the time of original sale. Therefore, this proposal 
        is not acceptable at all. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="some"></a><b>Some Rules of Parallel Salam </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        Since the modern Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions are using the 
        instrument of parallel Salam, some rules for the validity of this arrangement 
        are necessary to observe: <br>
        <b><br>
        1.</b> In an arrangement of parallel salam, the bank enters into two different 
        contracts. In one of them, the bank is the buyer and in the second one 
        the bank is the seller. Each one of these contracts must be independent 
        of the other. They cannot be tied up in a manner that the rights and obligations 
        of one contract are dependant on the rights and obligations of the parallel 
        contract. Each contract should have its own force and its performance 
        should not be contingent on the other. <br>
        <b><br>
        For example</b>, if A has purchased from B 1000 bags of wheat by way of 
        Salam to be delivered on 31 December, A can contract a parallel Salam 
        with C to deliver to him 1000 bags of wheat on 31 December. But while 
        contracting Parallel Salam with C, the delivery of wheat to C cannot be 
        conditioned with taking delivery from B. Therefore, even if B did not 
        deliver wheat on 31 December, A is duty bound to deliver 1000 bags of 
        wheat to C. He can seek whatever recourse he has against B, but he cannot 
        rid himself from his liability to deliver wheat to C. <br>
        Similarly, if B has delivered defective goods which do not conform with 
        the agreed specifications, A is still obligated to deliver the goods to 
        C according to the specifications agreed with him. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 2.</b> Parallel Salam is allowed with a third party only. The seller 
        in the first contract cannot be made purchaser in the parallel contract 
        of salam, because it will be a buy-back contract, which is not permissible 
        in Shari&#145;ah. Even if the purchaser in the second contract is a separate 
        legl entity, but it is fully owned by the seller in the first contract 
        the arrangement will not be allowed, because in practical terms it will 
        amount to 'buy-back' arrangement. For example A has purchased 1000 bags 
        of wheat by way of Salam from B, a joint stock company. B has a subsidiary 
        C, which is a separate legal entity but is fully owned by B. A cannot 
        contract the parallel salam with C. However, if C is not wholly owned 
        by B, A can contract parallel salam with it, even if some share-holders 
        are common between B and C. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="istisna"></a>ISTISNA&#145; </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        'Istisna&#145;' is the second kind of sale where a commodity is transacted 
        before it comes into existence. It means to order a manufacturer to manufacture 
        a specific commodity for the purchaser. If the manufacturer undertakes 
        to manufacture the goods for him with material from the manufacturer, 
        the transaction of istisna&#145; comes into existence. But it is necessary 
        for the validity of istisna&#145; that the price is fixed with the consent 
        of the parties and that necessary specification of the commodity (intended 
        to be manufactured) is fully settled between them. <br>
        The contract of istisna&#145; creates a moral obligation on the manufacturer 
        to manufacture the goods, but before he starts the work, any one of the 
        parties may cancel the contract after giving a notice to the other . However 
        after the manufacturer has started the work, the contract cannot be cancelled 
        unilaterally. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="difference"></a>Difference between Istisna&#145; and Salam 
        </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        Keeping in view this nature of istisna&#145; there are several points 
        of difference between istisna&#145; and salam which are summarized below: 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        (i)</b> The subject of istisna&#145; is always a thing which needs manufacturing, 
        while salam can be effected on any thing, no matter whether it needs manufacturing 
        or not. <br>
        <b><br>
        (ii)</b> It is necessary for salam that the price is paid in full in advance, 
        while it is not necessary in istisna&#145;. <br>
        <b><br>
        (iii)</b> The contract of salam, once effected, cannot be cancelled unilaterally, 
        while the contract of istisna&#145; can be cancelled before the manufacturer 
        starts the work. <br>
        <b><br>
        (iv)</b> The time of delivery is an essential part of the sale in salam 
        while it is not necessary in istisna&#145; that the time of delivery is 
        fixed. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="between"></a>Difference between Istisna&#145; and Ijarah 
        </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        It should also be kept in mind that the manufacturer, in istisna&#145;, 
        undertakes to make the required goods with his own material. Therefore, 
        this transaction implies that the manufacturer shall obtain the material, 
        if it is not already with him, and shall undertake the work required for 
        making the ordered goods with it. If the material is provided by the customer, 
        and the manufacturer is required to use his labor and skill only, the 
        transaction is not istisna&#145;. In this case it will be a transaction 
        of ijarah whereby the services of a person are hired for a specified fee 
        paid to him. <br>
        <br>
        When the required goods have been manufactured by the seller, he should 
        present them to the purchaser. But there is a difference of opinion among 
        the Muslim jurists whether or not the purchaser has a right to reject 
        the goods at this stage. Imam Abu Hanifah is of the view that he can exercise 
        his 'option of seeing' (Khiyar-ur-ru&#146;yah) after seeing the goods, 
        because istisna&#145; is a sale and if somebody purchases a thing which 
        is not seen by him, he has the option to cancel the sale after seeing 
        it. The same principle is also applicable to istisna&#145;. <br>
        <br>
        However, Imam Abu Yousuf says that if the commodity conforms to the specifications 
        agreed upon between the parties at the time of the contract, the purchaser 
        is bound to accept the goods and he cannot exercise the option of seeing. 
        This view has been preferred by the jurists of the Ottoman Empire, and 
        the Hanafi law has been codified according to this view, because it is 
        damaging in the context of modern trade and industry that after the manufacturer 
        has used all his resources to prepare the required goods, the purchaser 
        cancels the sale without assigning any reason, even though the goods are 
        in full conformity with the required specifications. <br>
        <br>
        <b> <a name="tm"></a>Time of Delivery </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        As pointed out earlier, it is not necessary in istisna&#145; that the 
        time of delivery is fixed. However, the purchaser may fix a maximum time 
        for delivery which means that if the manufacturer delays the delivery 
        after the appointed time, he will not be bound to accept the goods and 
        to pay the price. In order to ensure that the goods will be delivered 
        within the specified period, some modern agreements of this nature contain 
        a penal clause to the effect that in case the manufacturer delays the 
        delivery after the appointed time, he shall be liable to a penalty which 
        shall be calculated on daily basis. Can such a penal clause be inserted 
        in a contract of istisna&#145; according to Shari&#145;ah? Although the 
        classical jurists seem to be silent about this question while they discuss 
        the contract of istisna&#145;, yet they have allowed a similar condition 
        in the case of ijarah. They say that if a person hires the services of 
        a person to tailor his clothes, the fee may be variable according to the 
        time of delivery. The hirer may say that he will pay Rs. 100/- in case 
        the tailor prepares the clothes within one day and Rs. 80/- in case he 
        prepares them after two days. On the same analogy, the price in istisna&#145; 
        may be tied up with the time of delivery, and it will be permissible if 
        it is agreed between the parties that in the case of delay in delivery, 
        the price shall be reduced by a specified amount per day. <br>
        <b> <br>
        <a name="financing"></a>Istisna&#145; as a mode of financing </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        Istisna&#145; can be used for providing the facility of financing in certain 
        transactions, especially in the house finance sector. If the client has 
        his own land and he seeks financing for the construction of a house, the 
        financier may undertake to construct the house at that open land, on the 
        basis of istisna&#145;, and if the client has no land and he wants to 
        purchase the land also, the financier may undertake to provide him a constructed 
        house on a specified piece of land. <br>
        <br>
        Since it is not necessary in istisna&#145; that the price is paid in advance, 
        nor is it necessary that it is paid at the time of delivery, (it may be 
        deferred to any time according to the agreement of the parties,1), therefore, 
        the time of payment may be fixed in whatever manner they wish. The payment 
        may also be in installments. On the other hand, it is not necessary that 
        the financier himself constructs the house. He can enter into a parallel 
        contract of istisna&#145; with a third party, or may hire the services 
        of a contractor (other than the client). In both cases, he can calculate 
        his cost and fix the price of istisna&#145; with his client in a manner 
        which may give him a reasonable profit over his cost. The payment of installments 
        by the client may start, in this case, right from the day when the contract 
        of istisna&#145; is signed by the parties, and may continue during the 
        construction of the house and after it is handed over to the client. In 
        order to secure the payment of the installments, the title deeds of the 
        house or land, or any other property of the client may be kept by the 
        financier as a security, until the last installment is paid by the client. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The financier, in this case, will be responsible for the construction 
        of the house in full conformity with the specifications detailed in the 
        agreement. In the case of any discrepancy, the financier will undertake 
        such alteration at his own cost as may be necessary for bringing it in 
        harmony with the terms of the contract. <br>
        <br>
        The instrument of istisna&#145; may also be used for project financing 
        on similar lines. If a client wants to install an air-conditioning plant 
        in his factory, and the plant needs to be manufactured, the financier 
        may undertake to prepare the plant through the contract of istisna&#145; 
        according to the aforesaid procedure. Similarly, the contract of istisna&#145; 
        can be used for building a bridge or a highway. <br>
        <br>
        The modern BOT (Buy, Operate and Transfer) agreements may also be formalized 
        on the basis of istisna&#145;. If a government wants to construct a highway, 
        it may enter into a contract of istisna&#145; with a builder. The price 
        of istisna&#145;, in this case, may be the right of the builder to operate 
        the highway and collect tolls for a specified period.<br>
