        <p align="justify"><a name="intro"></a><b>&quot;Mudarabah&quot;</b> is 
          a special kind of partnership where one partner gives money to another 
          for investing it in a commercial enterprise. The investment comes from 
          the first partner who is called &quot;rabb-ul-mal&quot;, while the management 
          and work is an exclusive responsibility of the other, who is called 
          &quot;mudarib&quot;. <br>
          <br>
          <b>The difference between musharakah and mudarabah can be summarized 
          in the following points</b><br>
          <b><br>
          (1)</b> The investment in musharakah comes from all the partners, while 
          in mudarabah, investment is the sole responsibility of rabb-ul-mal. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>(2)</b> In musharakah, all the partners can participate in the management 
          of the business and can work for it, while in mudarabah, the rabb-ul-mal 
          has no right to participate in the management which is carried out by 
          the mudarib only.<br>
          <br>
          <b>(3)</b> In musharakah all the partners share the loss to the extent 
          of the ratio of their investment while in mudarabah the loss, if any, 
          is suffered by the rabb-ul-mal only, because the mudarib does not invest 
          anything. His loss is restricted to the fact that his labor has gone 
          in vain and his work has not brought any fruit to him. However, this 
          principle is subject to a condition that the mudarib has worked with 
          due diligence which is normally required for the business of that type. 
          If he has worked with negligence or has committed dishonesty, he shall 
          be liable for the loss caused by his negligence or misconduct. <br>
          <b><br>
          (4)</b> The liability of the partners in musharakah is normally unlimited. 
          Therefore, if the liabilities of the business exceed its assets and 
          the business goes in liquidation, all the exceeding liabilities shall 
          be borne pro rata by all the partners. However, if all the partners 
          have agreed that no partner shall incur any debt during the course of 
          business, then the exceeding liabilities shall be borne by that partner 
          alone who has incurred a debt on the business in violation of the aforesaid 
          condition. Contrary to this is the case of mudarabah. Here the liability 
          of rabb-ul-mal is limited to his investment, unless he has permitted 
          the mudarib to incur debts on his behalf. <br>
          <b><br>
          (5)</b> In musharakah, as soon as the partners mix up their capital 
          in a joint pool, all the assets of the musharakah become jointly owned 
          by all of them according to the proportion of their respective investment. 
          Therefore, each one of them can benefit from the appreciation in the 
          value of the assets, even if profit has not accrued through sales. <br>
          The case of mudarabah is different. Here all the goods purchased by 
          the mudarib are solely owned by the rabb-ul-mal, and the mudarib can 
          earn his share in the profit only in case he sells the goods profitably. 
          Therefore, he is not entitled to claim his share in the assets themselves, 
          even if their value has increased. </p align="justify">
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="business"></a>Business of the Mudarabah 
          </b>: - ( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          The rabb-ul-mal may specify a particular business for the mudarib, in 
          which case he shall invest the money in that particular business only. 
          This is called al-mudarabah al-muqayyadah (restricted mudarabah). But 
          if he has left it open for the mudarib to undertake whatever business 
          he wishes, the mudarib shall be authorized to invest the money in any 
          business he deems fit. This type of mudarabah is called 'al-mudarabah 
          al-mutlaqah&quot; (unrestricted mudarabah) <br>
          <br>
          A rabbul-mal can contract mudarabah with more than one person through 
          a single transaction. It means that he can offer his money to A and 
          B both, so that each one of them can act for him as mudarib and the 
          capital of the mudarabah shall be utilized by both of them jointly, 
          and the share of the mudarib shall be distributed between them according 
          to the agreed proportion. In this case both the mud&acirc;ribs shall 
          run the business as if they were partners inter se. <br>
          <br>
          The mudarib or mud&acirc;ribs, as the case may be, are authorized to 
          do anything which is normally done in the course of business. However, 
          if they want to do an extraordinary work, which is beyond the normal 
          routine of the traders, they cannot do so without express permission 
          from the rabb-ul-mal. </p align="justify">
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="distribution"></a>Distribution of the profit 
          </b>: - ( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          It is necessary for the validity of mudarabah that the parties agree, 
          right at the beginning, on a definite proportion of the actual profit 
          to which each one of them is entitled. No particular proportion has 
          been prescribed by the Shari&#145;ah; rather, it has been left to their 
          mutual consent. They can share the profit in equal proportions, and 
          they can also allocate different proportions for the rubb-ul-mal and 
          the mudarib. However, they cannot allocate a lump sum amount of profit 
          for any party, nor can they determine the share of any party at a specific 
          rate tied up with the capital. For example, if the capital is Rs. 100000/- 
          they cannot agree on a condition that Rs. 10000/- out of the profit 
          shall be the share of the mudarib, nor can they say that 20% of the 
          capital shall be given to rabb-ul-mal. However, they can agree on that 
          40% of the actual profit shall go to the mudarib and 60% to the rabb-ul-mal 
          or vice versa. <br>
          <br>
          It is also allowed that different proportions are agreed in different 
          situations. For example the rabbul-mal can say to mudarib, &quot;If 
          you trade in wheat, you will get 50% of the profit and if you trade 
          in flour, you will have 33% of the profit&quot;. Similarly, he can say 
          &quot;If you do the business in your town, you will be entitled to 30% 
          of the profit, and if you do it in another town, your share will be 
          50% of the profit. <br>
          Apart from the agreed proportion of the profit, as determined in the 
          above manner, the mudarib cannot claim any periodical salary or a fee 
          or remuneration for the work done by him for the mudarabah. <br>
          All the schools of Islamic Fiqh are unanimous on this point. However, 
          Imam Ahmad has allowed for the mudarib to draw his daily expenses of 
          food only from the mudarabah account. <br>
          <br>
          The Hanafi jurists restrict this right of the mudarib only to a situation 
          when he is on a business trip outside his own city. In this case he 
          can claim his personal expenses, accommodation, food, etc., but he is 
          not entitled to get anything as daily allowances when he is in his own 
          city. If the business has incurred loss in some transactions and has 
          gained profit in some others, the profit shall be used to offset the 
          loss at the first instance, then the remainder, if any, shall be distributed 
          between the parties according to the agreed ratio. </p align="justify">
        <p align="justify"><b><a name="termination"></a>Termination of Mudarabah 
          </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          The contract of mudarabah can be terminated at any time by either of 
          the two parties. The only condition is to give a notice to the other 
          party. If all the assets of the mudarabah are in cash form at the time 
          of termination, and some profit has been earned on the principal amount, 
          it shall be distributed between the parties according to the agreed 
          ratio. However, if the assets of the mudarabah are not in the cash form, 
          the mudarib shall be given an opportunity to sell and liquidate them, 
          so that the actual profit may be determined. <br>
          <br>
          There is a difference of opinion among the Muslim jurists about the 
          question whether the contract of mudarabah can be effected for a specified 
          period after which it terminates automatically. The Hanafi and Hanbali 
          schools are of the view that the mudarabah can be restricted to a particular 
          term, like one year, six months, etc, after which it will come to an 
          end without a notice. On the contrary, Shafi&#145;i and Maliki schools 
          are of the opinion that the mudarabah cannot be restricted to a particular 
          time. <br>
          <br>
          However, this difference of opinion relates only to the maximum time-limit 
          of the mudarabah. Can a minimum time-limit also be fixed by the parties 
          before which mudarabah cannot be terminated? No express answer to this 
          question is found in the books of Islamic Fiqh, but it appears from 
          the general principles enumerated therein that no such limit can be 
          fixed, and each party is at liberty to terminate the contract whenever 
          he wishes. <br>
          <br>
          This unlimited power of the parties to terminate the mudarabah at their 
          pleasure may create some difficulties in the context of the present 
          circumstances, because most of the commercial enterprises today need 
          time to bring fruits. They also demand constant and complex efforts. 
          Therefore, it may be disastrous to the project, if the rabb-ul-mal terminates 
          the mudarabah right in the beginning of the enterprise. Specially, it 
          may bring a severe set-back to the mudarib who will earn nothing despite 
          all his efforts. Therefore, if the parties agree, when entering into 
          the mudarabah, that no party shall terminate it during a specified period, 
          except in specified circumstances, it does not seem to violate any principle 
          of Shari&#145;ah, particularly in the light of the famous hadith, already 
          quoted, which says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p align="justify">
