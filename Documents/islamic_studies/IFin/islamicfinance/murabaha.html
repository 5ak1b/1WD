        Most of the Islamic banks and financial institutions are using &quot;Murabahah&quot; 
        as an Islamic mode of financing, and most of their financing operations 
        are based on &quot;Murabahah&quot;. That is why this term has been taken 
        in the economic circles today as a method of banking operations, while 
        the original concept of &quot;Murabahah&quot; is different from this assumption. 
        <br>
        &quot;Murabahah&quot; is, in fact, a term of Islamic Fiqh and it refers 
        to a particular kind of sale having nothing to do with financing in its 
        original sense. If a seller agrees with his purchaser to provide him a 
        specific commodity on a certain profit added to his cost, it is called 
        a &quot;murabahah&quot; transaction. The basic ingredient of &quot;murabahah&quot; 
        is that the seller discloses the actual cost he has incurred in acquiring 
        the commodity, and then adds some profit thereon. This profit may be in 
        lump sum or may be based on a percentage. <br>
        <br>
        The payment in the case of murabahah may be at spot, and may be on a subsequent 
        date agreed upon by the parties. Therefore, murabahah does not necessarily 
        imply the concept of deferred payment, as generally believed by some people 
        who are not acquainted with the Islamic jurisprudence and who have heard 
        about murabahah only in relation with the banking transactions. <br>
        <br>
        Murabahah, in its original Islamic connotation, is simply a sale. The 
        only feature distinguishing it from other kinds of sale is that the seller 
        in murabahah expressly tells the purchaser how much cost he has incurred 
        and how much profit he is going to charge in addition to the cost. <br>
        <br>
        If a person sells a commodity for a lump sum price without any reference 
        to the cost, this is not a murabahah, even though he is earning some profit 
        on his cost because the sale is not based on a &quot;cost-plus&quot; concept. 
        In this case, the sale is called &quot;Musawamah&quot;. <br>
        This is the actual sense of the term &quot;Murabahah&quot; which is a 
        sale, pure and simple. However, this kind of sale is being used by the 
        Islamic banks and financial institutions by adding some other concepts 
        to it as a mode of financing. But the validity of such transactions depends 
        on some conditions which should be duly observed to make them acceptable 
        in Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        <br>
        In order to understand these conditions correctly, one should, in the 
        first instance, appreciate that murabahah is a sale with all its implications, 
        and that all the basic ingredients of a valid sale should be present in 
        murabahah also. Therefore, this discussion will start with some fundamental 
        rules of sale without which a sale cannot be held as valid in Shari&#145;ah. 
        Then, we shall discuss some special rules governing the sale of Murabahah 
        in particular, and in the end the correct procedure for using the murabahah 
        as an acceptable mode of financing will be explained. <br>
        <br>
        An attempt has been made to reduce the detailed principles into concise 
        notes in the shortest possible sentences, so that the basic points of 
        the subject may be grasped at in one glance, and may be preserved for 
        easy reference. <b><br>
        <br>
        <a name="some"></a>Some Basic Rules of Sale: -</b> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        <br>
        'Sale' is defined in Shariah as 'the exchange of a thing of value by another 
        thing of value with mutual consent'. Islamic jurisprudence has laid down 
        enormous rules governing the contract of sale, and the Muslim jurists 
        have written a large number of books, in a number of volumes, to elaborate 
        them in detail. What is meant here is to give a summary of only those 
        rules which are more relevant to the transactions of murabahah as carried 
        out by the financial institutions: <br>
        <b><br>
        1.</b> The subject of sale must be existing at the time of sale. <br>
        Thus, a thing which has not yet come into existence cannot be sold. If 
        a non-existent thing has been sold, though by mutual consent, the sale 
        is void according to Shari&#145;ah. <br>
        Example: A sells the unborn calf of his cow to B. The sale is void. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 2.</b> The subject of sale must be in the ownership of the seller 
        at the time of sale. <br>
        Thus, what is not owned by the seller cannot be sold. If he sells something 
        before acquiring its ownership, the sale is void. <br>
        Example: A sells to B a car which is presently owned by C, but A is hopeful 
        that he will buy it from C and shall deliver it to B subsequently. The 
        sale is void, because the car was not owned by A at the time of sale. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        3.</b> The subject of sale must be in the physical or constructive possession 
        of the seller when he sells it to another person. <br>
        &quot;Constructive possession&quot; means a situation where the possessor 
        has not taken the physical delivery of the commodity, yet the commodity 
        has come into his control, and all the rights and liabilities of the commodity 
        are passed on to him, including the risk of its destruction. <br>
        <b><br>
        Examples : </b><br>
        <b>(i)</b> A has purchased a car from B. B has not yet delivered it to 
        A or to his agent. A cannot sell the car to C. If he sells it before taking 
        its delivery from B, the sale is void. <br>
        <br>
        <b> (ii)</b> A has purchased a car from B. B, after identifying the Car 
        has placed it in a garage to which A has free access and B has allowed 
        him to take the delivery from that place whenever he wishes. Thus the 
        risk of the Car has passed on to A.. The car is in the constructive possession 
        of A. If A sells the car to C without acquiring physical possession, the 
        sale is valid. <br>
        <b><br>
        Explanation 1:</b> <br>
        The gist of the rules mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 3 is that a person 
        cannot sell a commodity unless: <br>
        <b>(a)</b> It has come into existence. <br>
        <b>(b)</b> It is owned by the seller. <br>
        <b>(c)</b> It is in the physical or constructive possession of the seller. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Explanation 2:</b><br>
        There is a big difference between an actual sale and a mere promise to 
        sell. The actual sale cannot be effected unless the above three conditions 
        are fulfilled. However one can promise to sell something which is not 
        yet owned or possessed by him. This promise initially creates only a moral 
        obligation on the promisor to fulfil his promise, which is normally not 
        justifiable. Nevertheless, in certain situations, specially where such 
        promise has burdened the promise with some liability, it can be enforceable 
        through the courts of law. In such cases the court may force the promisor 
        to fulfil his promise, i.e. to effect the sale, and if he fails to do 
        so, the court may order him to pay the promise the actual damages he has 
        incurred due to the default of the promisor. <br>
        <br>
        But the actual sale will have to be effected after the commodity comes 
        into the possession of the seller. This will require separate offer and 
        acceptance, and unless the sale is effected in this manner, the legal 
        consequences of the sale shall not follow. <br>
        <b><br>
        Exception:</b><br>
        The rules mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 3 are relaxed with respect to two 
        types of sale, namely: <br>
        <b>(a)</b> Bai&#145; Salam <br>
        <b>(b)</b> Istisna&#146; <br>
        The rules of these two types will be discussed later in a separate chapter. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        4.</b> The sale must be instant and absolute. Thus a sale attributed to 
        a future date or a sale contingent on a future event is void. If the parties 
        wish to effect a valid sale, they will have to effect it afresh when the 
        future date comes or the contingency actually occurs. <br>
        <b><br>
        Examples: </b><br>
        <b>(a)</b> A says to B on the first of January: &quot;I sell my car to 
        you on the first of February&quot;. The sale is void, because it is attributed 
        to a future date. <br>
        <b>(b)</b> A says to B, &quot;If party X wins the elections, my car stands 
        sold to you&quot;. The sale is void, because it is contingent on a future 
        event. <br>
        <br>
        <b> 5.</b> The subject of sale must be a property of value. Thus, a thing 
        having no value according to the usage of trade cannot be sold or purchased. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> 6.</b> The subject of sale should not be a thing which is not used 
        except for a haram purpose, like pork, wine etc. <br>
        <b><br>
        7.</b> The subject of sale must be specifically known and identified to 
        the buyer. <br>
        <b><br>
        Explanation:</b> <br>
        The subject of sale may be identified either by pointation or by detailed 
        specification which can distinguish it from other things not sold. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example:</b><br>
        There is a building comprising a number of apartments built in the same 
        pattern. A, the owner of the building says to B, &quot;I sell one of these 
        apartments to you&quot;; B accepts. The sale is void unless the apartment 
        intended to be sold is specifically identified or pointed out to the buyer. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>8.</b> The delivery of the sold commodity to the buyer must be certain 
        and should not depend on a contingency or chance. <br>
        Example : A sells his car stolen by some anonymous person and the buyer 
        purchases it under the hope that he will manage to take it back. The sale 
        is void. <br>
        <b><br>
        9.</b> The certainty of price is a necessary condition for the validity 
        of a sale. If the price is uncertain, the sale is void. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example:</b> A says to B, &quot;If you pay within a month, the price is 
        Rs. 50. But if you pay after two months, the price is Rs. 55&quot;. B 
        agrees. The price is uncertain and the sale is void, unless anyone of 
        the two alternatives is agreed upon by the parties at the time of sale. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> 10.</b> The sale must be unconditional. A conditional sale is invalid, 
        unless the condition is recognized as a part of the transaction according 
        to the usage of trade. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example:</b><br>
        <b> (1)</b> A buys a car from B with a condition that B will employ his 
        son in his firm. The sale is conditional, hence invalid. <br>
        <br>
        <b> Example: <br>
        (2)</b> A buys a refrigerator from B, with a condition that B undertakes 
        its free service for 2 years. The condition, being recognized as a part 
        of the transaction, is valid and the sale is lawful. <b><br>
        <br>
        <a name="bai"></a>Bai&#145; Mu&#146;ajjal: -</b> ( <a href="#Top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        <b>(Sale on deferred payment basis) </b><br>
        <b>1</b>, A sale in which the parties agree that the payment of price 
        shall be deferred is called a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bai&#145; 
        Mu&#146;ajjal&quot;. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.</b> Bai&#145; Mu&#146;ajjal is valid if the due date of payment is 
        fixed in an unambiguous manner. <br>
        <b><br>
        3.</b> The due time of payment can be fixed either with reference to a 
        particular date, or by specifying a period, like three months, but it 
        cannot be fixed with reference to a future event the exact date of which 
        is unknown or is uncertain. If the time of payment is unknown or uncertain, 
        the sale is void. <br>
        <b><br>
        4</b>. If a particular period is fixed for payment, like one month, it 
        will be deemed to commence from the time of delivery, unless the parties 
        have agreed otherwise. <br>
        <b><br>
        5.</b>. The deferred price may be more than the cash price, but it must 
        be fixed at the time of sale. <br>
        <b><br>
        6</b>. Once the price is fixed, it cannot be decreased in case of earlier 
        payment, nor can it be increased in case of default. <br>
        <b><br>
        7</b>. In order to pressurize the buyer to pay the installments promptly, 
        the buyer may be asked to promise that in case of default, he will donate 
        some specified amount for a charitable purpose. In this case the seller 
        may receive such amount from the buyer, not to make it a part of his income, 
        but to use it for a charitable purpose on behalf of the buyer. The detailed 
        discussion on this subject will be found later in this chapter. <br>
        <b><br>
        8</b>. If the commodity is sold on installments, the seller may put a 
        condition on the buyer that if he fails to pay any installment on its 
        due date, the remaining installments will become due immediately. <br>
        <b><br>
        9.</b> In order to secure the payment of price, the seller may ask the 
        buyer to furnish a security whether in the form of a mortgage or in the 
        form of a lien or a charge on any of his existing assets. <br>
        <b>10.</b> The buyer can also be asked to sign a promissory note or a 
        bill of exchange, but the note or the bill cannot be sold to a third party 
        at a price different from its face value. <b><br>
        <br>
        <a name="murab"></a>Murabahah </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        <b><br>
        1.</b> Murabahah is a particular kind of sale where the seller expressly 
        mentions the cost of the sold commodity he has incurred, and sells it 
        to another person by adding some profit or mark-up thereon. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.</b> The profit in Murabahah can be determined by mutual consent, either 
        in lump sum or through an agreed ratio of profit to be charged over the 
        cost. <br>
        <b><br>
        3.</b> All the expenses incurred by the seller in acquiring the commodity 
        like freight, custom duty etc. shall be included in the cost price and 
        the mark-up can be applied on the aggregate cost. However, recurring expenses 
        of the business like salaries of the staff, the rent of the premises etc. 
        cannot be included in the cost of an individual transaction. In fact, 
        the profit claimed over the cost takes care of these expenses. <br>
        <b><br>
        4.</b> Murabahah is valid only where the exact cost of a commodity can 
        be ascertained. If the exact cost cannot be ascertained, the commodity 
        cannot be sold on murabahah basis. In this case the commodity must be 
        sold on musawamah (bargaining) basis i.e. without any reference to the 
        cost or to the ratio of profit / mark-up. The price of the commodity in 
        such cases shall be determined in lump sum by mutual consent. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example (1)</b> A purchased a pair of shoes for Rs. 100/-. He wants to 
        sell it on murabahah with 10% mark-up. The exact cost is known. The murabahah 
        sale is valid. <br>
        <b><br>
        Example (2)</b> &quot;A purchased a ready - made suit with a pair of shoes 
        in a single transaction, for a lump sum price of Rs. 500/-. A can sell 
        the suit including shoes on murabahah. But he cannot sell the shoes separately 
        on Murabahah, because the individual cost of the shoes is unknown. If 
        he wants to sell the shoes separately, he must sell it at a lump sum price 
        without reference to the cost or to the mark-up.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="mode"></a>Murabahah as a mode of financing </b>( <a href="#Top">Top</a> 
        )<br>
        Originally, murabahah is a particular type of sale and not a mode of financing. 
        The ideal mode of financing according to Shariah is mudarabah or musharakah 
        which have been discussed in the first chapter. However, in the perspective 
        of the current economic set up, there are certain practical difficulties 
        in using mudarabah and musharakah instruments in some areas of financing. 
        Therefore, the contemporary Shariah experts have allowed, subject to certain 
        conditions, the use of the murabahah on deferred payment basis as a mode 
        of financing. But there are two essential points which must be fully understood 
        in this respect: <br>
        <b><br>
        1</b>. It should never be overlooked that, originally, murabahah is not 
        a mode of financing. It is only a device to escape from &quot;interest&quot; 
        and not an ideal instrument for carrying out the real economic objectives 
        of Islam. Therefore, this instrument should be used as a transitory step 
        taken in the process of the Islamization of the economy, and its use should 
        be restricted only to those cases where mudarabah or musharakah are not 
        practicable. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.</b> The second important point is that the murabahah transaction does 
        not come into existence by merely replacing the word of &quot;interest&quot; 
        by the words of &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;mark-up&quot;. Actually, murabahah 
        as a mode of finance, has been allowed by the Shariah scholars with some 
        conditions. Unless these conditions are fully observed, murabahah is not 
        permissible. In fact, it is the observance of these conditions which can 
        draw a clear line of distinction between an interest-bearing loan and 
        a transaction of murabahah. If these conditions are neglected, the transaction 
        becomes invalid according to Shariah. <b><br>
        <br>
        <a name="features"></a>Basic features of Murabahah Financing: -</b> ( 
        <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
        <br>
        <b>1.</b> Murabahah is not a loan given on interest. It is the sale of 
        a commodity for a deferred price which includes an agreed profit added 
        to the cost. <br>
        <b><br>
        2.</b> Being a sale, and not a loan, the murabahah should fulfil all the 
        conditions necessary for a valid sale, especially those enumerated earlier 
        in this chapter. <br>
        <b><br>
        3.</b> Murabahah cannot be used as a mode of financing except where the 
        client needs funds to actually purchase some commodities. For example, 
        if he wants funds to purchase cotton as a raw material for his ginning 
        factory, the Bank can sell him the cotton on the basis of murabahah. But 
        where the funds are required for some other purposes, like paying the 
        price of commodities already purchased by him, or the bills of electricity 
        or other utilities or for paying the salaries of his staff, murabahah 
        cannot be effected, because murabahah requires a real sale of some commodities, 
        and not merely advancing a loan. <br>
        <b><br>
        4.</b> The financier must have owned the commodity before he sells it 
        to his client. <br>
        <b><br>
        5.</b> The commodity must come into the possession of the financier, whether 
        physical or constructive, in the sense that the commodity must be in his 
        risk, though for a short period. <br>
        <b><br>
        6.</b> The best way for murabahah, according to Shariah, is that the financier 
        himself purchases the commodity and keeps it in his own possession, or 
        purchases the commodity through a third person appointed by him as agent, 
        before he sells it to the customer. However, in exceptional cases, where 
        direct purchase from the supplier is not practicable for some reason, 
        it is also allowed that he makes the customer himself his agent to buy 
        the commodity on his behalf. In this case the client first purchases the 
        commodity on behalf of his financier and takes its possession as such. 
        Thereafter, he purchases the commodity from the financier for a deferred 
        price. His possession over the commodity in the first instance is in the 
        capacity of an agent of his financier. In this capacity he is only a trustee, 
        while the ownership vests in the financier and the risk of the commodity 
        is also borne by him as a logical consequence of the ownership. But when 
        the client purchases the commodity from his financier, the ownership, 
        as well as the risk, is transferred to the client. <br>
        <b><br>
        7.</b> As mentioned earlier, the sale cannot take place unless the commodity 
        comes into the possession of the seller, but the seller can promise to 
        sell even when the commodity is not in his possession. The same rule is 
        applicable to Murabahah. <br>
        <b><br>
        8.</b> In the light of the aforementioned principles, a financial institution 
        can use the Murabahah as a mode of finance by adopting the following procedure: 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        Firstly:</b> The client and the institution sign an over-all agreement 
        whereby the institution promises to sell and the client promises to buy 
        the commodities from time to time on an agreed ratio of profit added to 
        the cost. This agreement may specify the limit upto which the facility 
        may be availed. <br>
        <b><br>
        <br>
        Secondly:</b> When a specific commodity is required by the customer, the 
        institution appoints the client as his agent for purchasing the commodity 
        on its behalf, and an agreement of agency is signed by both the parties. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        Thirdly:</b> The client purchases the commodity on behalf of the institution 
        and takes its possession as an agent of the institution. <br>
        <b><br>
        Fourthly:</b> The client informs the institution that he has purchased 
        the commodity on his behalf, and at the same time, makes an offer to purchase 
        it from the institution. <br>
        <b><br>
        Fifthly:</b> The institution accepts the offer and the sale is concluded 
        whereby the ownership as well as the risk of the commodity is transferred 
        to the client. <br>
        All these five stages are necessary to effect a valid murabahah. If the 
        institution purchases the commodity directly from the supplier (which 
        is preferable) it does not need any agency agreement. In this case, the 
        second phase will be dropped and at the third stage the institution itself 
        will purchase the commodity from the supplier, and the fourth phase will 
        be restricted to making an offer by the client. <font color="#993300">THE 
        MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION IS THAT THE COMMODITY MUST REMAIN 
        IN THE RISK OF THE INSTITUTION DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE THIRD AND 
        THE FIFTH STAGE.</font> This is the only feature of murabahah which can 
        distinguish it from an interest-based transaction. Therefore, it must 
        be observed with due diligence at all costs, otherwise the murabahah transaction 
        becomes invalid according to Shariah. <br>
        <b><br>
        9.</b> It is also a necessary condition for the validity of murabahah 
        that the commodity is purchased from a third party. The purchase of the 
        commodity from the client himself on 'buy back' agreement is not allowed 
        in Shariah. Thus murabahah based on 'buy back' agreement is nothing more 
        than an interest based transaction. <br>
        <b><br>
        10.</b> The above mentioned procedure of the murabahah financing is a 
        complex transaction where the parties involved have different capacities 
        at different stages. <br>
        <b><br>
        (a)</b> At the first stage, the institution and the client promise to 
        sell and purchase a commodity in future. This is not an actual sale. It 
        is just a promise to effect a sale in future on murabahah basis. Thus 
        at this stage the relation between the institution and the client is that 
        of a promisor and a promise. <br>
        <b><br>
        (b)</b> At the second stage, the relation between the parties is that 
        of a principal and an agent. <br>
        <b><br>
        (c)</b> At the third stage, the relation between the institution and the 
        supplier is that of a buyer and seller. <br>
        <b><br>
        (d)</b> At the fourth and fifth stage, the relation of buyer and seller 
        comes into operation between the institution and the client, and since 
        the sale is effected on deferred payment basis, the relation of a debtor 
        and creditor also emerges between them simultaneously. <br>
        All these capacities must be kept in mind and must come into operation 
        with all their consequential effects, each at its relevant stage, and 
        these different capacities should never be mixed up or confused with each 
        other. <br>
        <b><br>
        11.</b> The institution may ask the client to furnish a security to its 
        satisfaction for the prompt payment of the deferred price. He may also 
        ask him to sign a promissory note or a bill of exchange, but it must be 
        after the actual sale takes place, i.e. at the fifth stage mentioned above. 
        The reason is that the promissory note is signed by a debtor in favour 
        of his creditor, but the relation of debtor and creditor between the institution 
        and the client begins only at the fifth stage, whereupon the actual sale 
        takes place between them. <br>
        <b><br>
        12.</b> In the case of default by the buyer in the payment of price at 
        the due date, the price cannot be increased. However, if he has undertaken, 
        in the agreement to pay an amount for a charitable purpose, as mentioned 
        in para 7 of the rules of Bai' Mu'ajjal, he shall be liable to pay the 
        amount undertaken by him. But the amount so recovered from the buyer shall 
        not form part of the income of the seller / the financier. He is bound 
        to spend it for a charitable purpose on behalf of the buyer, as will be 
        explained later in detail.</p align="justify">
