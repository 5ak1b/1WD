          <font color="#6666CC"><b><a name="Intro"></a><font color="#000000">'Musharakah'</font></b></font> 
          is a word of Arabic origin which literally means sharing. In the context 
          of business and trade it means a joint enterprise in which all the partners 
          share the profit or loss of the joint venture. It is an ideal alternative 
          for the interest-based financing with far reaching effects on both production 
          and distribution. In the modern capitalist economy, interest is the 
          sole instrument indiscriminately used in financing of every type. Since 
          Islam has prohibited interest, this instrument cannot be used for providing 
          funds of any kind. Therefore, 'Musharakah' can play a vital role in 
          an economy based on Islamic principles. <br>
          <br>
          'Interest' predetermines a fixed rate of return on a loan advanced by 
          the financier irrespective of the profit earned or loss suffered by 
          the debtor, while Musharakah does not envisage a fixed rate of return. 
          Rather, the return in Musharakah is based on the actual profit earned 
          by the joint venture. The financier in an interest-bearing loan cannot 
          suffer loss while the financier in Musharakah can suffer loss, if the 
          joint venture fails to produce fruits. Islam has termed interest as 
          an unjust instrument of financing because it results in injustice either 
          to the creditor or to the debtor. If the debtor suffers a loss, it is 
          unjust on the part of the creditor to claim a fixed rate of return; 
          and if the debtor earns a very high rate of profit, it is injustice 
          to the creditor to give him only a small proportion of the profit leaving 
          the rest for the debtor. <br>
          <br>
          In the modern economic system, it is the banks which advance depositors' 
          money as loans to industrialists and traders. If industrialists having 
          only ten million of their own, acquire 90 million from the banks and 
          embark on a huge profitable project, it means that 90% of the project 
          has been created by the money of the depositors while only 10% has been 
          created by their own capital. If this huge project brings enormous profits, 
          only a small proportion i.e. 14 or 15% will go to the depositors through 
          the bank, while all the rest will be gained by the industrialists whose 
          real contribution to the project is not more than 10%. Even this small 
          proportion of 14 or 15% is taken back by the industrialists, because 
          this proportion is included by them in the cost of their production. 
          The net result is that all the profit of the enterprise is earned by 
          the persons whose own capital does not exceed 10% of the total investment, 
          while the people owning 90% of the investment get no more than the fixed 
          rate of interest which is often repaid by them through the increased 
          prices of the products. On the contrary, if in an extreme situation, 
          the industrialists go insolvent, their own loss is no more than 10%, 
          while the rest of 90% is totally borne by the bank, and in some cases, 
          by the depositors. In this way, the rate of interest is the main cause 
          for imbalances in the system of distribution, which has a constant tendency 
          in favor of the rich and against the interests of the poor. <br>
          <br>
          Conversely, Islam has a clear cut principle for the financier. According 
          to Islamic principles, a financier must determine whether he is advancing 
          a loan to assist the debtor on humanitarian grounds or he desires to 
          share his profits. If he wants to assist the debtor, he should resist 
          from claiming any excess on the principal of his loan, because his aim 
          is to assist him. However, if he wants to have a share in the profits 
          of his debtor, it is necessary that he should also share him in his 
          losses. Thus the returns of the financier in Musharakah have been tied 
          up with the actual profits accrued through the enterprise. The greater 
          the profits of the enterprise, the higher the rate of return to the 
          financier. If the enterprise earns enormous profits, all of it cannot 
          be secured by the industrialist exclusively, but they will be shared 
          by the common people as depositors in the bank. In this way, Musharakah 
          has a tendency to favor the common people rather than the rich only. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This is the basic philosophy which explains why Islam has suggested 
          Musharakah as an alternative to the interest based financing. No doubt, 
          Musharakah embodies a number of practical problems in its full implementation 
          as a universal mode of financing. It is sometimes presumed that Musharakah 
          is an old instrument which cannot keep pace with the ever-advancing 
          need for speedy transactions. However, this presumption is due to the 
          lack of proper knowledge concerning the principles of Musharakah. In 
          fact, Islam has not prescribed a specific form or procedure for Musharakah. 
          Rather, it has set some broad principles which can accommodate numerous 
          forms and procedures. A new form or procedure in Musharakah cannot be 
          rejected merely because it has no precedent in the past. In fact, every 
          new form can be acceptable to the Shariah in so far as it does not violate 
          any basic principle laid down by the Holy Qur&#146;an, the Sunnah or 
          the consensus of the Muslim jurists. Therefore, it is not necessary 
          that Musharakah be implemented only in its traditional old form. <br>
          <br>
          The present chapter contains a discussion of the basic principles of 
          Musharakah and the way in which it can be implemented in the context 
          of modern business and trade. This discussion is aimed at introducing 
          Musharakah as a modern mode of financing without violating its basic 
          principles in any way. Musharakah has been introduced with reference 
          to the books of Islamic jurisprudence, and basic problems which may 
          be faced in implementing it in a modern situation. It is hoped that 
          this brief discussion will open new horizons for the thinking of Muslim 
          jurists and economists and may help implementing a true Islamic economy.<br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="concept"></a>The Concept of Musharakah </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          Musharakah&quot; is a term frequently referred to in the context of 
          Islamic modes of financing. The connotation of this term is a little 
          limited than the term &quot;Shirkah&quot; more commonly used in the 
          Islamic jurisprudence. For the purpose of clarity in the basic concepts, 
          it will be pertinent at the outset to explain the meaning of each term, 
          as distinguished from the other. <br>
          <br>
          &quot;Shirkah&quot; means &quot;Sharing&quot; and in the terminology 
          of Islamic Fiqh, it has been divided into two kinds: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(1) Shirkat-ul-milk</b>: It means joint ownership of two or more 
          persons in a particular property. This kind of &quot;Shirkah&quot; may 
          come into existence in two different ways: Sometimes it comes into operation 
          at the option of the parties. For example, if two or more persons purchase 
          an equipment, it will be owned jointly by both of them and the relationship 
          between them with regard to that property is called &quot;Shirkat-ul-milk.&quot; 
          Here this relationship has come into existence at their own option, 
          as they themselves elected to purchase the equipment jointly. <br>
          <br>
          But there are cases where this kind of &quot;Shirkah&quot; comes to 
          operate automatically without any action taken by the parties. For example, 
          after the death of a person, all his heirs inherit his property which 
          comes into their joint ownership as an automatic consequence of the 
          death of that person. <br>
          <br>
          <b>(2) Shirkat-ul-&#145;aqd</b>: This is the second type of Shirkah 
          which means &quot;a partnership effected by a mutual contract&quot;. 
          For the purpose of brevity it may also be translated as &quot;joint 
          commercial enterprise.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          Shirkat-ul-&#145;aqd is further divided into three kinds: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(i)</b> Shirkat-ul-amwal where all the partners invest some capital 
          into a commercial enterprise. <br>
          <br>
          <b>(ii)</b> Shirkat-ul-A&#145;mal where all the partners jointly undertake 
          to render some services for their customers, and the fee charged from 
          them is distributed among them according to an agreed ratio. For example, 
          if two persons agree to undertake tailoring services for their customers 
          on the condition that the wages so earned will go to a joint pool which 
          shall be distributed between them irrespective of the size of work each 
          partner has actually done, this partnership will be a shirkat-ul-a&#145;mal 
          which is also called Shirkat-ut-taqabbul or Shirkat-us-sana&#146;i&#145; 
          or Shirkat-ul-abdan. <br>
          <br>
          <b>(iii)</b>The third kind of Shirkat-ul-&#145;aqd is Shirkat-ul-wujooh. 
          Here the partners have no investment at all. All they do is that they 
          purchase the commodities on a deferred price and sell them at spot. 
          The profit so earned is distributed between them at an agreed ratio. 
          <br>
          <br>
          All these modes of &quot;Sharing&quot; or partnership are termed as 
          &quot;Shirkah&quot; in the terminology of Islamic Fiqh, while the term 
          &quot;musharakah&quot; is not found in the books of Fiqh. This term 
          (i.e. musharakah) has been introduced recently by those who have written 
          on the subject of Islamic modes of financing and it is normally restricted 
          to a particular type of &quot;Shirkah&quot;, that is, the Shirkat-ul-amwal, 
          where two or more persons invest some of their capital in a joint commercial 
          venture. However, sometimes it includes Shirkat-ul-a&#145;mal also where 
          partnership takes place in the business of services. <br>
          <br>
          It is evident from this discussion that the term &quot;Shirkah&quot; 
          has a much wider sense than the term &quot;musharakah&quot; as is being 
          used today. The latter is limited to the &quot;Shirkat-ul-amwal &quot; 
          only, while the the former includes all types of joint ownership and 
          those of partnership. Table 1 will show the different kinds of &quot;Shirkah&quot; 
          and the two kinds which are called Musharakah&quot; in the modern terminology. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Since &quot;musharakah&quot; is more relevant for the purpose of our 
          discussion, and it is almost analogous to &quot;Shirkat-ul-amwal&quot;, 
          we shall now dwell upon it, explaining at the first instance, the traditional 
          concept of this type of Shirkah, then giving a brief account of its 
          application to the concept of financing in the modern context.<br>
          <br>
          <a name="basic"></a><b>The basic rules of Musharakah </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. </b>Musharakah or Shirkat-ul-amwal is a relationship established 
          by the parties through a mutual contract. Therefore, it goes without 
          saying that all the necessary ingredients of a valid contract must be 
          present here also. For example, the parties should be capable of entering 
          into a contract; the contract must take place with free consent of the 
          parties without any duress, fraud or misrepresentation, etc., etc. <br>
          <br>
          But there are certain ingredients which are peculiar to the contract 
          of &quot;musharakah&quot;. They are summarized here: <br>
          <br>
          <a name="Distribution"></a><b>Distribution of Profit </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          The proportion of profit to be distributed between the partners must 
          be agreed upon at the time of effecting the contract. If no such proportion 
          has been determined, the contract is not valid in Shari&#145;ah. <br>
          <br>
          The ratio of profit for each partner must be determined in proportion 
          to the actual profit accrued to the business, and not in proportion 
          to the capital invested by him. It is not allowed to fix a lump sum 
          amount for any one of the partners, or any rate of profit tied up with 
          his investment. <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if A and B enter into a partnership and it is agreed between 
          them that A shall be given Rs 10,000/- per month as his share in the 
          profit, and the rest will go to B, the partnership is invalid. Similarly, 
          if it is agreed between them that A will get 15% of his investment, 
          the contract is not valid. The correct basis for distribution would 
          be an agreed percentage of the actual profit accrued to the business. 
          <br>
          <br>
          If a lump sum amount or a certain percentage of the investment has been 
          agreed for any one of the partners, it must be expressly mentioned in 
          the agreement that it will be subject to the final settlement at the 
          end of the term, meaning thereby that any amount so drawn by any partner 
          shall be treated as 'on account payment' and will be adjusted to the 
          actual profit he may deserve at the end of the term. But if no profit 
          is actually earned or is less than anticipated, the amount drawn by 
          the partner shall have to be returned. <br>
          <br>
          Is it necessary that the ratio of profit of each partner conforms to 
          the ratio of capital invested by him? There is a difference of opinion 
          among the Muslim jurists about this question. <br>
          <br>
          In the view of Imam Malik and Imam Shafi&#145;i, it is necessary for 
          the validity of musharakah that each partner gets the profit exactly 
          in the proportion of his investment. Therefore, if A has invested 40% 
          of the total capital, he must get 40% of the profit. Any agreement to 
          the contrary which makes him entitled to get more or less than 40% will 
          render the musharakah invalid in Shari&#145;ah. <br>
          <br>
          On the contrary, the view of Imam Ahmad is that the ratio of profit 
          may differ from the ratio of investment if it is agreed between the 
          partners with their free consent. Therefore, it is permissible that 
          a partner with 40% of investment gets 60% or 70% of the profit, while 
          the other partner with 60% of investment gets only 40% or 30%. <br>
          <br>
          The third view is presented by Imam Abu Hanifah which can be taken as 
          a via media between the two opinions mentioned above. He says that the 
          ratio of profit may differ from the ratio of investment in normal conditions. 
          However, if a partner has put an express condition in the agreement 
          that he will never work for the musharakah and will remain a sleeping 
          partner throughout the term of musharakah, then his share of profit 
          cannot be more than the ratio of his investment. <br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="sharing"></a>Sharing of Loss </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          But in the case of loss, all the Muslim jurists are unanimous on the 
          point that each partner shall suffer the loss exactly according to the 
          ratio of his investment. Therefore, if a partner has invested 40% of 
          the capital, he must suffer 40% of the loss, not more, not less, and 
          any condition to the contrary shall render the contract invalid. There 
          is a complete consensus of jurists on this principle. 3 <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, according to Imam Shafi&#145;i, the ratio of the share of 
          a partner in profit and loss both must conform to the ratio of his investment. 
          But according to Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad, the ratio of the profit 
          may differ from the ratio of investment according to the agreement of 
          the partners, but the loss must be divided between them exactly in accordance 
          with the ratio of capital invested by each one of them. It is this principle 
          that has been mentioned in the famous maxim: <br>

          <b><a name="nature"></a>The Nature of the Capital </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          Most of the Muslim jurists are of the opinion that the capital invested 
          by each partner must be in liquid form. It means that the contract of 
          musharakah can be based only on money, and not on commodities. In other 
          words, the share capital of a joint venture must be in monetary form. 
          No part of it can be contributed in kind. However, there are different 
          views in this respect. <br>
          <br>
          <b>1.</b> Imam Malik is of the view that the liquidity of capital is 
          not a condition for the validity of musharakah, therefore, it is permissible 
          that a partner contributes to the musharakah in kind, but his share 
          shall be determined on the basis of evaluation according to the market 
          price prevalent at the date of the contract. This view is also adopted 
          by some Hanbali jurists. <br>
          <br>
          <b>2.</b> Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad are of the view that no contribution 
          in kind is acceptable in a musharakah. Their standpoint is based on 
          two reasons: <br>
          <br>
          Firstly, they say that the commodities of each partner are always distinguishable 
          from the commodities of the other. For example, if A has contributed 
          one motor car to the business, and B has come with another motor car, 
          each one of the two cars is the exclusive property of its original owner. 
          Now, if the car of A is sold, its sale-proceeds should go to A. B has 
          no right to claim a share in its price. Therefore, so far as the property 
          of each partner is distinguished from the property of the other, no 
          partnership can take place. On the contrary, if the capital invested 
          by every partner is in the form of money, the share capital of each 
          partner cannot be distinguished from that of the other, because the 
          units of money are not distinguishable, therefore, they will be deemed 
          to form a common pool, and thus the partnership comes into existence. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Secondly, they say, there are a number of situations in a contract of 
          musharakah where the partners have to resort to redistribution of the 
          share-capital to each partner. If the share-capital was in the form 
          of commodities, such redistribution cannot take place, because the commodities 
          may have been sold at that time. If the capital is repaid on the basis 
          of its value, the value may have increased, and there is a possibility 
          that a partner gets all the profit of the business, because of the appreciation 
          in the value of the commodities he has invested, leaving nothing for 
          the other partner. Conversely, if the value of those commodities decreases, 
          there is a possibility that one partner secures some part of the original 
          price of the commodity of the other partner in addition to his own investment. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>3.</b> Imam al-Shafi&#145;i has come with a via media between the 
          two points of view explained above. He says that the commodities are 
          of two kinds: <br>
          <br>
          <b>(i) Dhawat-ul-amthal</b> <img src="arabic_Natureofcatpial_musharakah.gif" width="115" height="38">i.e. 
          the commodities which, if destroyed, can be compensated by the similar 
          commodities in quality and quantity e.g. wheat, rice etc. If 100 kilograms 
          of wheat are destroyed, they can easily be replaced by another 100 kg. 
          of wheat of the same quality. <br>
          <br>
          <b>(ii) Dhawat-ul-qeemah</b> <img src="arabic_natureofcaptial_musharakah.gif" width="102" height="38">&nbsp;i.e. 
          the commodities which cannot be compensated by the similar commodities, 
          like the cattle. Each head of sheep, for example, has its own characteristics 
          which cannot be found in any other head. Therefore, if somebody kills 
          the sheep of a person, he cannot compensate him by giving him similar 
          sheep. Rather, he is required to pay their price. <br>
          <br>
          Now, Imam al-Shafi&#145;i says that the commodities of the first kind 
          (i.e. Dhawat-ul-amthal) may be contributed to the musharakah as the 
          share of a partner in the capital, while the commodities of the second 
          kind (i.e. the Dhawat-ul-qeemah) cannot form part of the share capital. 
          <br>
          <br>
          By this distinction between Dhawat-ul-amthal and Dhawat-ul-qeemah, Imam 
          al-Shafi&#145;i has met the second objection on 'participation by commodities' 
          as was raised by Imam Ahmad. For in the case of Dhawat-ul-amthal, redistribution 
          of capital may take place by giving to each partner the similar commodities 
          he had invested. However, the first objection remains still unanswered 
          by Imam al-Shafi&#145;i. <br>
          <br>
          In order to meet this objection also, Imam Abu Hanifah says that the 
          commodities falling under the category of Dhawat-ul-amthal can form 
          part of the share capital only if the commodities contributed by each 
          partner have been mixed together, in such a way that the commodity of 
          one partner cannot be distinguished from that of the other. <br>
          <br>
          In short, if a partner wants to participate in a musharakah by contributing 
          some commodities to it, he can do so according to Imam Malik without 
          any restriction, and his share in the musharakah shall be determined 
          on the basis of the current market value of the commodities, prevalent 
          at the date of the commencement of musharakah. According to Imam al-Shafi&#145;i, 
          however, this can be done only if the commodity is from the category 
          of Dhawat-ul-amthal. <br>
          <br>
          According to Imam Abu Hanifah, if the commodities are Dhawat-ul-amthal, 
          this can be done by mixing the commodities of each partner together. 
          And if the commodities are Dhawat-ul-qeemah, then, they cannot form 
          part of the share capital. <br>
          <br>
          It seems that the view of Imam Malik is more simple and reasonable and 
          meets the needs of the modern business. Therefore, this view can be 
          acted upon. <br>
          <br>
          We may, therefore, conclude from the above discussion that the share 
          capital in a musharakah can be contributed either in cash or in the 
          form of commodities. In the latter case, the market value of the commodities 
          shall determine the share of the partner in the capital.<br>
          <b><a name="management"><br>
          </a>Management of Musharakah</b> ( <a href="#top">Top</a> )<br>
          <br>
          The normal principle of musharakah is that every partner has a right 
          to take part in its management and to work for it. However, the partners 
          may agree upon a condition that the management shall be carried out 
          by one of them, and no other partner shall work for the musharakah. 
          But in this case the sleeping partner shall be entitled to the profit 
          only to the extent of his investment, and the ratio of profit allocated 
          to him should not exceed the ratio of his investment, as discussed earlier. 
          <br>
          <br>
          However, if all the partners agree to work for the joint venture, each 
          one of them shall be treated as the agent of the other in all the matters 
          of the business and any work done by one of them in the normal course 
          of business shall be deemed to be authorized by all the partners. <br>
          <br>
          <b><a name="Termination"></a>Termination of Musharakah </b>( <a href="#top">Top</a> 
          )<br>
          <br>
          Musharakah is deemed to be terminated in any one of the following events: 
          <br>
          <b><br>
          (1)</b> Every partner has a right to terminate the musharakah at any 
          time after giving his partner a notice to this effect, whereby the musharakah 
          will come to an end. <br>
          In this case, if the assets of the musharakah are in cash form, all 
          of them will be distributed pro rata between the partners. But if the 
          assets are not liquidated, the partners may agree either on the liquidation 
          of the assets, or on their distribution or partition between the partners 
          as they are. If there is a dispute between the partners in this matter 
          i.e. one partner seeks liquidation while the other wants partition or 
          distribution of the non-liquid assets themselves, the latter shall be 
          preferred, because after the termination of musharakah, all the assets 
          are in the joint ownership of the partners, and a co-owner has a right 
          to seek partition or separation, and no one can compel him on liquidation. 
          However, if the assets are such that they cannot be separated or partitioned, 
          such as machinery, then they shall be sold and the sale-proceeds shall 
          be distributed. <br>
          <b><br>
          (2)</b> If any one of the partners dies during the currency of musharakah, 
          the contract of musharakah with him stands terminated. His heirs in 
          this case, will have the option either to draw the share of the deceased 
          from the business, or to continue with the contract of musharakah. <br>
          <b><br>
          (3)</b> If any one of the partners becomes insane or otherwise becomes 
          incapable of effecting commercial transactions, the musharakah stands 
          terminated. Termination of Musharakah without closing the business If 
          one of the partners wants termination of the musharakah, while the other 
          partner or partners like to continue with the business, this purpose 
          can be achieved by mutual agreement. The partners who want to run the 
          business may purchase the share of the partner who wants to terminate 
          his partnership, because the termination of musharakah with one partner 
          does not imply its termination between the other partners. <br>
          However, in this case, the price of the share of the leaving partner 
          must be determined by mutual consent, and if there is a dispute about 
          the valuation of the share and the partners do not arrive at an agreed 
          price, the leaving partner may compel other partners on the liquidation 
          or on the distribution of the assets themselves. <br>
          <br>
          The question arises whether the partners can agree, while entering into 
          the contract of the musharakah, on a condition that the liquidation 
          or separation of the business shall not be effected unless all the partners, 
          or the majority of them wants to do so, and that a single partner who 
          wants to come out of the partnership shall have to sell his share to 
          the other partners and shall not force them on liquidation or separation. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Most of the traditional books of Islamic Fiqh seem to be silent on this 
          question. However, it appears that there is no bar from the Shari&#145;ah 
          point of view if the partners agree to such a condition right at the 
          beginning of the musharakah. This is expressly permitted by some Hanbali 
          jurists. This condition may be justified, especially in the modern situations, 
          on the ground that the nature of business, in most cases today, requires 
          continuity for its success, and the liquidation or separation at the 
          instance of a single partner only may cause irreparable damage to the 
          other partners. <br>
          <br>
          If a particular business has been started with huge amounts of money 
          which has been invested in a long term project, and one of the partners 
          seeks liquidation in the infancy of the project, it may be fatal to 
          the interests of the partners, as well as to the economic growth of 
          the society, to give him such an arbitrary power of liquidation or separation. 
          Therefore, such a condition seems to be justified, and it can be supported 
          by the general principle laid down by the Holy Prophet &#146;<img src="../namaz/Darood.gif" width="33" height="36">in 
          his famous hadith: <br>

          So far the basic concept of shirkat-ul-amwal or musharakah in its original 
          and traditional sense have been summarized. <br>
          Now we are in a position to discuss some basic issues involved in its 
          application to the modern conditions as an approved mode of financing. 
          But it seems more pertinent to discuss these issues after giving an 
          introductory account of mudarabah which is another type of profit-sharing 
          and a typical mode of financing. Since the rules of financing in both 
          musharakah and mudarabah are similar and the issues involved in their 
          application are inter related, it will be more useful to discuss the 
          concept of mudarabah before embarking on these issues.<br>
